## Section One: Before You Begin

- **Remember that, as the trainer and initial contact point, _YOU_ represent ESC and lead in with the first impression of our group. Proper execution is critical. Stay organized, timely, and polite. Get things ready *before* you send the IM to the recruit.**
- Trainers are expected to completely follow through with any recruits they pick up, from initiating training through graduation, unless arranged and agreed upon with another trainer.
- Training session time varies, but can be lengthy. If you know you will run short on time, establish a specific follow-up date and time for the future, not just "later."
- If your plans fall through, you are responsible for checking in on your recruit.

## Section Two: Expedited Or Full
On occasion, ESC will recruit individuals who have already spent a significant amount of time in the SLMC, either recently in another group, or as older veterans of past groups. These "veteran" recruits have already gained relevant combat proficiency and will be, on a case-by-case basis, permitted to skip Phase Four in an effort to save time and stay efficient. All other phases must be completed, regardless of trainee veteran status.

When the recruit's application is accepted, if this designation applies, it will be determined by Foundation administration or ESC command staff prior to commencement of training. If no such designation is provided, the trainee should, by default, undergo all training.

## Section Three: Group Setup
1. Reach out to the prospective recruit. Congratulate them on their acceptance into the group and ask them if they are ready to begin.
2. Invite the trainee to the Foundation, Home, and Land groups.
   - If you do not have rights to furnish invitations, reach out for assistance. Ping on Discord if you need to. Officers have this ability as do many NCOs.
3. Invite them to the Discord using the link provided in the trainer channel on discord and change their role using Epsilon Bot.
   - The command is " !trainee @discordname#number " and you will need to manually type in their username (the trainer channel shouldn't have recruits in it).
   - All trainers should be able to do this, but if you cannot use the command, seek assistance from othe Training staff.
4. Have the trainee set their SL client homepoint in the spawn area.

## Section Four: Primer
+ This step is only required for trainees who are brand new to the SLMC or have not been active for long periods of time (2+ years).

New and long-absent recruits must be (re)introduced to what the SLMC is and how the community as a whole operates. [Furnish them a copy of the SLMC primer.](https://github.com/ElesCloud/ESCDocuments/blob/main/SLMCPrimer.md) The rest of training builds on this basic knowledge. Be sure to give the trainee plenty of time to read this and ask any questions they might have, or read it to them.

## Section Five: Update
Denote the recruit's initation and completion of Phase One in the trainee-status channel on Discord.
   - Use this template in the channel to track progress:
