## Section One: Before You Begin

- Remember that, as the trainer, **YOU** are the initial contact. YOU represent ESC and lead in with the first impression. Proper execution is critical.
  - Stay organized, timely, and polite. Get things ready *before* you send the IM to the recruit.
- Trainers are expected to follow through with all recruits they pick up, from initiating training through graduation.
- The training session time varies but can be lengthy. If you are not prepared to spend a few hours with the recruit, set up a follow-up meeting with the recruit later.
- If your plans fall through, you are responsible for checking in on your recruit.

## Section Two: Group Setup
1. Reach out to the prospective recruit. Congratulate them on their acceptance into the group and ask them if they are ready to begin.
   - As mentioned above, if you are unable to continue training after initial contact and setup, you should attempt to settle on a specific time with the recruit (avoid simply saying "sometime later") to follow up for the next session.
2. Invite the trainee to the Foundation, Home, and Land groups.
   - If you cannot furnish invitations, reach out for assistance. Ping if you need to. Officers have this ability as do many NCOs.
3. Invite them to the Discord using the link provided in the trainer channel on discord and change their role using Epsilon Bot.
   - The command is " !trainee @discordname#number "
   - All trainers should be able to do this, but if you cannot use the command, ask another trainer or the superintendent for help.
4. Denote the recruit's initiation into to Phase One in the trainer-chat on Discord.
   - This will aid us in staying efficient and organized, so we are not constantly wondering who has done what.
   - **Also, to receive credit for the trainers-only Showstopper reward, you must post each phase individually.**
   - Use this template in the channel to track progress:
     - Trainer:

5. Have the trainee set their SL client homepoint in the spawn area.

## Section Three: Expedited Or Full?
All trainees invited to Epsilon Security Consulting must undergo Phases One, Two, Three, and Five. However, on occasion, ESC will recruit individuals who have already spent a significant amount of time in the SLMC, either recently in another group, or as older veterans of past groups. These "veteran" recruits have already gained relevant combat proficiency and will be, on a case-by-case basis, permitted to skip Phase Four in an effort to save time and stay efficient. 

When the recruit's application is accepted, their designation will be determined by Foundation administrators or command staff prior to commencement of training.

**PHASE ONE COMPLETE. Proceed to [Phase Two](https://github.com/ElesCloud/ESCDocuments/blob/main/Training_PhaseTwo.md).**
