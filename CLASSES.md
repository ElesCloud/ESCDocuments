# Chapter One: Introduction
The intended purpose of this document is to explain how the class and unlock system works to all members of ESC.
 
Because this is a **live** document that may change frequently, updates are detailed in the commit log.

# Chapter Two: How to Rank Up
Upon promotion to rank C-2, each ESC member will choose a primary combat class and will be awarded their first unlock point for that class. The first four points after that are earned by continued participation in combat. The second rank is awarded at 20 combat events, and then one point is awarded for every ten eligible combat events after that (combat that is not paid out through the database, such as less than 3v3 event, does not count). All five of the first five points go towards the primary class chosen.

After Rank 5 has been achieved, personnel may then multiclass. An additional five class points are available to earn for a total of ten (for a total of 100 combat operations logged to achieve maximum rank), and these last five points may be applied to any of the other three classes as desired.

After Rank 10, a third way of earning points is available - see the next section for more information.

# Chapter Three: Senior Contracted and Class Resets

## Senior Contracted
When an ESC Contracted member reaches C-8, they may be eligible for an opportunity to branch out into senior contracted ranks. The Senior Contracted system has been put in place to offer additional advancement to those who will not be permitted to or have decided not to take on the responsibilities required to advance into NCO+. Through this system, additional rewards are made available such as: class points, weapons, cosmetics, and so on. Senior Enlisted ranks are earned through peer recommendation, and those recommendations are reviewed by NCO+ and awarded during regular promotion cycles along with other promotions. Below are the current unlocks available at each level.

| Rank | Rewards Obtained |
| --- | --- |
| Se. Contracted I | +1 Additional Class Point; Renelli M5 Combat Shotgun; Bronze Tier Badge |
| Sr. Contracted II | +1 Additional Class Point; Mk. II Upper Leg Pads for the KHS armor set; KHS Backpack (*backpack to be inmplemented in the future*) |
| Sr. Contracted III | +1 Additional Class Point; Shock Rifle; Silver Tier Badge |
| Sr. Contracted IV | +1 Additional Class Point; Fur Mantle Accessory; Exclusive Camo Kit for the Kusanagi Hard Suit armor set (*camo to be implemented in the future*) |
| Sr. Contracted V | +1 Additional Class Point; Malorian Arms 3516 (Nivanglus's "special boy" pistol); Gold Tier Badge |

Additional Senior Contracted unlocks may be added in the future - check back and watch for announcements.

## Class Resets
Do you feel that the primary class you chose was not the right pick? Every ESC member is afforded ***one*** opportunity to respec. If you choose to respec, your one free "respec token" will be expended and your primary class points will be made available again to be reapplied to a different class. By doing this, you will lose access to any unlocks from the classes you left behind. 

Contact a member of Command to do this until the database function is added.
