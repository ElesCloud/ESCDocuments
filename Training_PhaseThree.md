## Section One: Movement Course
Bring the recruit to the movement course. The movement course can be accessed by the "Training" teleport button on the teleporter menu. This course is designed to test not just the recruit's ability to utilize SL's physics quirks, but also to test their patience and persistence.

Rules to note:
- The course must be completed fully from start to finish under a trainer's observation to pass.
- There is no time limit.
- The purple-colored pads are checkpoint areas. The recruit should set their homepoint on these to save progress. This requires the Land group.
- All movemement enhancement is prohibited. The course was not designed to require anything other than regular running and jumping. 
  - This includes the standard dodgeroll in the HUD. The recruit should detach the HUD for this section.
  - Any attempts made that involved cheating are invalid and will not count toward passing.
- If the recruit hasn't made any progress in an extended time and there are extenuating circumstances that clearly bar them from succeeding despite their best efforts, the course *may* be skipped.
  - Examples of extenuating circumstances include: 
    - A real-life physical condition that limits their reaction time
    - Subpar internet service
    - Low-end computer hardware
  - **This must be documented clearly in the progress notes.**
  - **A recruit who misrepresents these circumstances to get out of the course will be shamed and face disciplinary action.**

Trainers are not required to lead the recruit through the entire course. However, they may be required to demonstrate specific sections to the recruit if they struggle, so trainers must be able to successfully complete the course themselves. 
* Starting with this edition of the training materials, prospective trainers will be required to demonstrate their ability before they qualify to train others.
