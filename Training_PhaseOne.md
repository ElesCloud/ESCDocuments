## Section One: Before You Begin

- Remember that, as a Foundation trainer, YOU represent ESC and create the first impression of our group. Proper execution is critical. Be prepared and proactive.
- Trainers are expected to completely follow through with any recruits they take on, through graduation, unless arranged and agreed upon with another trainer.
- Training session times can be lengthy. If you can't complete a session, set a specific follow-up time in the future.

## Section Two: Group Setup
1. Reach out to the prospective recruit. Congratulate them on their acceptance into the group and ask them if they are ready to begin.
2. Invite the trainee to the SL Foundation and Home groups.
   - If you do not have rights to furnish invitations in these groups, seek assistance. Ping on Discord if you need to. Officers have this ability as do many NCOs.
3. Invite them to the Discord using the link provided in the trainer channel on discord and change their role using Epsilon Bot.
   - The command is " !trainee @discordname#number " and you will need to manually type in their username (the trainer channel is for trainers, and doesn't have recruits in it).
   - All trainers should be able to do this, but if the command doesn't work, get help from other Foundation staff.
4. Have the trainee set their SL client homepoint in the spawn area.

## Section Three: Primer
+ This step is conditional - only required for trainees who are brand new to the SLMC or have not been active for several years.

The primer is a basic introduction into what the Second Life Military Community is. [Furnish them a copy of the SLMC primer.](https://github.com/ElesCloud/ESCDocuments/blob/main/SLMCPrimer.md) The rest of training builds on this basic knowledge. Be sure to give the trainee plenty of time to read this and ask any questions they might have, or read it to them.

## Section Five: Update
Denote the recruit's initation and completion of Phase One in the trainee-status channel on Discord.
   - Use this template in the channel to track progress:
