## Chapter One: Background and Mission Statement

> *“Epsilon Security Consulting is a subsidiary of Epsilon Pharmaceutical Corporation. Set in a dystopian future where automation has fully replaced human labor and plutocracy reigns with an iron fist, most individuals are born with a life debt to megacorporations that act as pseudo-governments. This life debt is repaid through indentured employment. This is the case for Epsilon personnel. They are conscripted and sponsored by Epsilon Pharmaceutical Corporation to provide asset security in exchange for a chance at freedom.”*

Epsilon Security Consulting was created in 2019 by Nivanglus Aya, Aurora Guffey, and Sin Straaf, the original founders and Directors of the organization. The mission of Epsilon Security Consulting is to sustain and renew what remains of the Second Life Military Community. Our theme draws inspiration from various elements in video games and sci-fi, dystopic, and cyberpunk pop culture to create its own flavor unique to this community. We will try our best to make SLMC combat fun for our members, and we strive to ensure that everyone is welcome to join and carve themselves out a place here.



## Chapter Two: Code

### Cooperation
ESC will make every reasonable attempt to ensure that the atmosphere is as welcoming and enjoyable as possible. However, a handful of particularly unpleasant individuals in the SLMC take advantage of the anonymity and paucity of consequences for their actions to abuse others. The ability to respond to this behavior is limited, and existing in this community unfortuantely means taking the bullshit in stride and not allowing one's self to take things personally. Even so, there are still some lines in the sand that even the SLMC won't cross, and they've come to be known as "Big Four" offenses. They are:

- Distribution of identifying non-public real-life information about others without their consent or knowledge (known as doxxing)
- GPU crashing or any other griefing that is able or designed to permanently damage a user's real PC hardware
- Theft, or unauthorized use or distribtion, of another user's creative assets (ripping textures, copybotting, etc.)
- Abuse of the AR (abuse report) system; that is, a bad-faith attempt to provoke a direct response from Linden Labs to get someone's account suspended or banned.
  - It is not considered abuse when individuals have a reason to involve LL for actions that go beyond the scope of what is handled within the community - for example, harassment or stalking, threats of real-life violence, or the other Big Four abuses mentioned above.
 
The common denominator in each offense is its potential to cause real and tangible harm outside of SL. For that reason, a "Big Four" offense generally means exclusion from the entire community. That is the closest the community, at least right now, can get to being on the same page about holding its members accountable.

ESC (and SL as a whole) is a population made up individuals from many walks of life. Each of us has a different set of life experiences, morals, and goals, none more or less important than any other. It is up to **everyone** in ESC at every rank and station to ensure that this diversity is leveraged as collective strenth instead of allowed to breed conflict.

The Second Life Military Community has so far been a complex patchwork of many different groups throughout its nearly two decade lifespan. If you have spent any significant amount of time in the SLMC already, you will probably encounter people from your past. These people may have been on the "bad guys" side before, but we are all ESC now. **Please, leave your grudges at the door.**


### Input and Output
Epsilon Security Consulting was founded on the concept of thinking outside the box and doing better. We aim to cultivate openness to new concepts, personal growth, adaptability, and a positive attitude.

You will get out of the group what you put in. Inaction and apathy will net you nothing. Genuine interest and effort will be recognized and rewarded.


### Professionalism
Mistakes are expected, but we must own up to shortcomings and strive to do better next time. Finger-pointing and blame-shifting are unhelpful.

Individuality and expression are encouraged. However, that freedom of expression is limited to the extent that it is not disruptive to others in the group.

Everyone within the group is assumed to be an adult and is expected to act like one.



## Chapter Three: Policy

### General Conduct
1. All ESC personnel should strive to exhibit conduct that reflects Chapter Two: Code principles at all times.
2. Interpersonal conflicts between members should be resolved by a cool-headed conversation first, if at all possible. If a dispute arises that cannot be settled this way, or if there is a situation that requires immediate intervention, the situation should be escalated to officer staff.
2. Disciplinary actions are administered by officer staff or members of the Omega Bureau. Officers and Omega Bureau Arbiters are afforded the full trust of Command and the discretion to administer as they see fit.
   - All decisions made by officers and the Omega Bureau are considered final (barring overrides by a Director). 
4. ESC personnel will follow chain of command. 
   - The vast majority of issues that crop up can and should be addressed by either a direct supervisor, NCO, or officer. These resources should be consulted **first**.
   - Nobody should go straight to Command without a very good reason. 
   - This does not mean that Command can't be approached *ever*, but their limited free time should be respected and they should be seen as a last resort.


### Visitors
1. We want new people to come see our sim and join us. Unarmed visitors will be welcomed as guests if they behave.
   - If a visitor causes a problem, they should be contacted by IM and warned to stop first, then shot if they don't comply after a reasonable allowance of time.
     - Exception: if the individual is clearly griefing, an estate manager (NCO+) should be contacted to intervene immediately if not already present.
   - All estate management actions from official warnings up are to be logged. Recordings and screen captures of incidents should be forwarded to officer staff.

2. Armed - weapons attached AND drawn - individuals that exit the attacker spawn are generally considered hostile.
   - Exception: a visitor who is not known to regularly attack ESC should be given an opportunity to disarm. An IM request to stand down is sufficient.
   - If a visitor is given an opportunity to disarm but moves onto the field without complying, they are considered a target.

3. Visitors invited by ESC personnel may be allowed in restricted areas with supervision.
   - The guests' invitee assumes personal responsibility for their guest's behavior.


### Combat Protocols
1. During combat, the designated officer in charge (OIC) is the individual responsible for all combat-related decisions.
   - Despite the implication of the name, OICs do not necessarily need to be officers. **"Backseat OICing" is not tolerated. The OIC's directives are not up for debate.**
   - Any messages from opponents should be passed to the OIC to be addressed and not responded to individually.
   - The OIC should be given a reasonable amount of time to address problems. If there are multiple issues, they should be IMed to the OIC in a list. Recordings and screenshots should be forwarded to the OIC if they are obtained.
   - During active combat, the HUD will display a Message of the Day that lists specific gear authorizations for that event. All participants are expected to pay attention to the MOTD.
     - The authorization categories have been done away with, but gear escalation is to be done with the OIC on board. If the OIC says no, it doesn't matter if we allow it by default.
     - An open armory doesn't mean carte blanche to be an asshole and the context of a combat event matters.

2. ESC makes use of Discord for voice communication during combat, and for announcements and recordkeeping.
   - Personnel are expected to be able to at least log in to hear what is going on. Being able to talk is not required.
   - ESC personnel should have their nicknames set to match their SL username or display name, or at least have it in parentheses. We reserve the right to alter your nickname if you don't comply.
   - Observe COMSEC. Things discussed in internal channels should stay in internal channels.

3. During any combat operations, communcation should be reasonably on topic and contributing positively to the conversation.
   - **If the OIC or an NCO+ individual in the party calls for the topic to be changed, the topic stops there.**
   - Participants who are getting upset and not having fun should step back and take a break or drop from the event.
   - ESC personnel should not mute other ESC personnel except in rare approved cases, cleared with administration.

4. Gear restrictions apply.
   - ESC personnel may only use gear made available from the official armory, no exceptions.
     - Non-standard and unreleased versions of ESC gear are reserved for R&D/QA and are only permitted for the purpose of official testing and development.
     - Personal project items and independently commissioned works are prohibited.
     - Some items in the ESC armory have commercially-sold variants. These variants are not permitted for use.
   -  ESC Subcontractors have their own list of approved gear to use, found [on the Subcontractors info page.](https://github.com/ElesCloud/ESCDocuments/blob/main/Subcontractors.md)

5. Participation in the militia groups of other SLMC entities is permitted with one stipulation:
   - ESC personnel may not fight with that militia group when it attacks or defends against ESC.
   - An exception may be made if they have the express permission of ESC's OIC prior to engagement, or if the combat is free-for-all at a neutral region.


#### Defensive Protocols
1. Some attackers who come to fight don't organize under a group and instead fight independently. These "lone wolves" typically come with lower-quality equipment and less tactical advantage than participants in an organized group do.
   - To keep things fair, lone wolves should be handled one-to-one and matched for gear.
3. ESC personnel are expected to be aware of our own sim rules. The most recent edition can be found [here](https://github.com/Nivanglus/Epsilon-Rules/blob/master/Rules.md).

#### Offensive Protocols
1. ESC personnel are responsible for following the defending group's rules while visiting.
   - The OIC of the raid party should learn the defending group’s rules and alert the raiding party to any key restrictions or special conditions.
   - Ideally, a copy of the opponent’s rules of engagement should be close at hand to be consulted if needed.
   - The OIC is responsible for ensuring that all members of the raid party arrive and are able to set their home points in the appropriate place.

2. ESC personnel are permitted to engage in combat on their own outside of official ESC events. Stipulations apply.
   - ESC personnel may not wear the ESC uniform or tag or otherwise imply that they are acting on behalf of ESC while fighting independently.
   - ESC gear is acceptable to use, up to and including vehicles, but excluding items not fully released from development.
   - ESC will not act to appeal any admin actions imposed by other SLMC groups or region owners for misconduct during unsanctioned events.
     - In addition, personnel may be subject to internal discipline as well, depending on the context and severity of misconduct that is observed.
   - **Bottom line: you are on your own. Exercise discretion and common sense.**

### Dress Code

##### Modifications
1. Everyone is encouraged to add personality to their uniforms and modify to their taste. As mentioned in Chapter Two: Code, there should be a balance between individual expression and group representation.
   - Modifications are generally acceptable as long as they:
     - don't clash with our general sci-fi/cyberpunk theme,
     - aren't a source of significant distraction, and
     - don't excessively demand resources (GPU usage and script count).
2. Specific rules for the Kusanagi Hard Suit: 
   - At no point should the rank badge be obscured. If its default area on the upper arm piece is covered, it should be moved to somewhere else that is visible.
   - "Key" pieces of the KHS set - the chest piece, upper arms, and thigh pieces - may not be replaced, removed, shrunk down, or obscured to the point that they no longer can be easily seen overall.
     - Official armory-release upgrades for those key parts (the Ashigaru, Diamas, and Guardian shoulderpads, the Senior Contracted upper leg plates, and the digi armored boots, for example) may replace the default parts.
3. Revealing, "sexy", and kink-oriented modifications are prohibited.
   - This part of the dress code was left to somewhat loose interpretation because what is considered "revealing" is subjective to the individual. This can and will change if the flexibility is abused.
4. The uniform should be used on bipedal, anthropomorphic avatars only.
5. If you want to modify your uniform and you have any degree of uncertainty as to whether or not it's acceptable, ask before you add it or change it.

##### Tinting
1. Parts of the combat armor are blank textured/white and set to glow (LEDs).
   - You are encouraged to tint these LEDs in "Epsilon Blue" (hex code #8fdaff) or any color of your choosing.
   - These parts are the ONLY parts that have NO restrictions.
2. Most of the rest of the combat armor is in shades of gray with specific trim colors.
   - Some parts of newer armor and accessories, like the Mk.2/Senior Contracted upper leg plates, have sections that are not LEDs/glowy bits, but are designed to be recolored. These non-glowing recolorable areas are treated like the non-modifiable armor trim on the default set. That means that the following colors or combinations are **reserved** for their appropriate rank brackets and unlocks:
     - Red - NCO
     - Gold - Officer
     - White/gold - Command
     - Purple
     - Bounty Hunter Camo
3. The only other acceptable tint adjustment is to slightly darken the overall color of the armor set with shade of gray. This tint should be subtle and not stand out when compared to the default.

4. These restrictions alsoa apply for any weapons with applicable NCO/officer skins.

##### Time and Place
1. ESC personnel are expected to wear the appropriate attire at all times while in service.
   - One of the two uniforms must be worn while at our home base, with a few exceptions:
     - The space hub and lounge are designated always-casual areas.
     - Sundays are designated casual days, and occasionally on holidays, a casual day may be authorized.
       - Personnel may defend or skirmish in casual apparel on casual days, but raids to other regions will be uniformed as usual. 
   - Casual wear still needs to follow minimum standards. No overly revealing outfits are allowed. Use common sense.
   - The Seraph light/formal set must be worn at biweekly general meetings. It was made for formal events.
2. Personnel may wear the uniform away from home base, especially for conventions or other public events where ESC is participating.
     - This includes general public areas like stores, sandboxes, and other non-adult themed areas.
     - This does NOT include any 18+ hangouts, clubs, bars, or RP sims. PG ONLY. ESC uniforms don't belong in your fetishes.
   - In all cases, personnel should be mindful of the image they are presenting and ensure it is a positive one.


## Chapter Four: Structure

### SUBCONTRACTOR

*These individuals are not members of Epsilon Security Consulting, but they are considered trustworthy enough to be allowed to join combat with ESC members and are considered friends. This is ESC's equivalent to a militia.*

- More info on Subcontractors is [here.]( https://github.com/ElesCloud/ESCDocuments/blob/main/Subcontractors.md)

### FOUNDATION
- F-1 // CONSCRIPT
  - *All trainees introduced to the group are conscripts for the duration of their training.*

### CORE
**CONTRACTED**

*Contracted are the enlisted members of the group, the main rank and file. They hold no enforcement authority and have minimum responsibility other than to be consistently present. Senior Contracted are additional ranks branching off of C-8 given as a reward to dedicated and talented Contracted with no specific responsibility expectations attached.*

- CONTRACTED
  - C-1 // CONTRACTOR
  - C-2 // AGENT
  - C-3 // OPERATOR
  - C-4 // SPECIALIST
  - C-5 // COURSER
  - C-6 // PREFECT
  - C-7 // WATCHER
  - C-8 // SENTINEL
 
- SENIOR CONTRACTED
  - SC-I
  - SC-II
  - SC-III
  - SC-IV
  - SC-V 

**NON-COMMISSIONED OFFICERS**

*Non-commissioned officers are members of ESC who show budding leadership skills and do more than just show up. They are afforded a moderate amount of trust and some tools to administrate. They often hold some sort of limited leadership role or are consistently been involved in one or more Ancillary Department roles.*

- NCOS
  - NCO-1 // WARDEN
  - NCO-2 // SUPERVISOR
  - NCO-3 // SENIOR SUPERVISOR

- WARRANT OFFICERS
  - W-1 // GUARDIAN
  - W-2 // ENFORCER

### ADMINISTRATION

*Administration is composed of Officer and Command staff. These individuals are have proven leadership capability and are afforded full trust and discretion to enforce policy. They hold significant responsibilities and run day-to-day operations for major areas of the group,*

- OFFICERS
  - O-1 // CAPTAIN
  - O-2 // MAJOR
  - O-3 // COMMANDER

- COMMAND
  - B-1 // OVERSEER
  - B-2 // ASSISTANT DIRECTOR
  - B-3 // DIRECTOR

| ![Rankplates2](https://github.com/ElesCloud/ESCDocuments/blob/main/rankplates2.png) |
|:---:|

### ANCILLARY DEPARTMENTS
*These are additional roles that ESC personnel may participate in that involve work above and beyond combat.*

- Research and Development
  - *Internal and external branches. Develops assets (creative content such as meshes, scripts, animations, land builds; database systems; other items as needed) for the organization.*
  - *Subgroup: Quality Assurance - beta tests gear for bugs*
- Foundation
  - *Educates and acclimates new recruits to the organization.*
- Omega Bureau
  - *Internal affairs and external affairs. Resolves disputes between members. Bridges between administration and other SLMC groups. Omega Bureau members are often also officers but do not necessarily need to be.*
- Combat Operations
  - *Educates individuals on OIC skills, schedules and encourages raids, promotes combat.*
  - *Subgroup: Pathfinders - maintains a repository of data on raid targets and helps derive strategies for success when raiding*


# Chapter Five: Combat Classes and Gear

ESC personnel are able to unlock a considerable array of gear to enrich and diversify the experience of combat. This is done through an in-house credits system. Credits are earned by actively participating in combat. The standard pay rate is 60 credits per hour/one credit per minute.

To be eligible for payment, a combat operation must meet three criteria:
  - The operation must consist of at least three individuals on at least two opposing teams.
  - The operation must have a designated OIC for each participating team.
  - The operation must be officially recorded via a report in ESC's records (at this time, on the forums).

Time spent idle is not compensated. However, if there are too many ESC already on the field, active observers will still be paid (key word - **active**, not idle). More preference is afford to junior-ranked participants when determining who is fielded and who gets put on standby. Officers and Command have distrcetion to add bonus credits or increase the rate of pay to compensate for extraordinary events. Weekends and off-prime (for US) hours are also given extra incentive.

In addition to the standard gear available to be unlocked by credits, ESC also implements an unlock point system for specialized equipment. Personnel are not constrained to one class or another, but the specialized gear does still fall into certain roles on the field. Those roles currently are:

- Assault
  - Aggressive, up-front, high-firepower gunplay.
- Technician
  - Indirect support and battlefield control.
- Mechanized
  - Mechs - massive robots that walk on two legs with big weapons. Armored tanks too.
- Airborne
  - Thing that dominate the atmosphere above - fighter jets, gunships, fleetships. 
 
More information about what's available for specialized gear can be found in [this document](https://github.com/ElesCloud/ESCDocuments/blob/main/CLASSES.md).



# Chapter Six: Epilogue

This handbook was designed and is currently maintained by Eles Nebula. If you have any questions, you can reach out by IM, or ask any officer. Suggestions are welcome.

Remember that ignorance is not an excuse for failure to observe policy.

Thank you for reading.
