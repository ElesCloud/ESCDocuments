# Chapter One: Introduction
The intended purpose of this document is to explain how the class system works to all members of ESC.
 
Because this is a **live** document that may change frequently, updates are detailed in the commit log.

# Chapter Two: How to Rank Up
Upon obtaining a promotion to rank C-2, each ESC member will be given the chance to choose their primary class. Rank points are generated through raids and defenses. Skirmishes are not eligible to count towards progress. 

Until automated systems are added, each ESC member is expected to keep a log of combat attendances that apply and submit them to the CO/XO of that combat class for review and awarding.

Below is a list of the each rank and the minimum requirements to reach each one:
- R1: Promoted to rank C-2
- R2: Participated in 20 combat operations
- R3: Participated in 30 combat operations
- R4: Participated in 40 combat operations
- R5: Participated in 50 combat operations

While each class has its own flavor and choosing your first is a big step, there is more beyond that. The ability to multiclass is available upon reaching Rank 5 in your primary class. At Rank 5, you will be able to obtain an additional five rank points through continued combat contribution and place them in the remaining classes as desired. They are not constrained to any specific class beyond your first five. Want to have two points in a secondd class and three more in a third? It's your choice.

Below are the requirements for the remaining five points:
- R6: 60 Combat operations
- R7: 70 Combat operations
- R8: 80 Combat operations
- R9: 90 Combat operations
- R10: 100 Combat operations


# Chapter Three: Prestige Mode and Class Resets

## Prestige Mode
***This system is not yet implemented.***
So you’ve earned that final class point and it appears that there's nothing left to do with the class system? Not so! Upon reaching Rank 10, you are able to manually reset your progress via the database and progress through the class ranks again for additional rewards at each rank, ultimately ending with a special armor skin and an 11th class point.

## Class Resets
Do you feel that the primary class you chose was not the right pick? Every ESC member is afforded ***one*** opportunity to respec. If you choose to respec, your one free "respec token" will be expended and your primary class points will be made available again be reapplied to a different class. By doing this, you will lose access to any unlocks from the classes you left behind. 

Contact a member of Command to do this until the database function is added.
