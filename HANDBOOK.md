## Chapter One: Background

> “Epsilon Security Consulting is a subsidiary group of Epsilon Pharmaceutical Corporation. In a time when automation has all but replaced human labor, individuals are born into debt which they repay by indentured employment to mega-corporations such as Epsilon Pharmaceutical Corporation. This is the case specifically for Epsilon personnel. They are conscripted and sponsored by Epsilon Pharmaceutical Corporation to provide asset security in exchange for the repayment of their life debt.”

Epsilon Security Consulting was created in 2019 by Nivanglus Aya, Aurora Guffey, and Sin Straaf, the original founders and Directors of the organization. The main goal of Epsilon Security Consulting is to sustain and, if possible, renew the stagnant and shrinking Second Life Military Community however possible. We are committed to creating a relaxed and fun but responsible atmosphere. We strive to ensure that everyone is welcome to join and find their place, provided that they can prove themselves.



## Chapter Two: Code

### Cooperation
The Second Life Military Community (SLMC) is made up of many different personalities. Some are great, plenty are terrible, and most are somewhere in between. However, even for the shittiest among us, there are some lines that should never be crossed. Below is a list of acts that are generally agreed upon to be the "Big Four Offenses". 

If you commit a "Big Four Offense", you will likely no longer be welcome anywhere. They are as follows:
- Distribution of identifying real-life information about others (doxxing)
- GPU crashing or any other griefing intended to damage a user's real-life PC hardware
- Creative content theft and distribution (ripping, copybotting, etc)
- Abuse of the Linden Labs AR (abuse report) system; that is, a bad-faith attempt to provoke a direct response from LL with the malicious intent to have someone's account suspended or banned.
  - This, of course does, not apply for cases where individuals have a good-faith reason to involve LL (for example, threats of real-life violence, etc).

We are made up of individuals from many walks of life. We all have our own life experiences, morals, and goals. It is up to **everyone**, from the top of this organization to the bottom, to ensure that this diversity is leveraged as strength to the group instead of breeding conflict.

The Second Life Military Community has been a complex patchwork of many different groups throughout its nearly two decade lifespan. If you have spent any significant amount of time here, you are likely to encounter people from your past. These people may have been on the "bad guys" side before. **Leave grudges at the door.**


### Input and Output
Epsilon Security Consulting was founded on the concept of thinking outside the box and always striving to improve. We ultimately value and want to cultivate openness to new concepts, personal growth, adaptability, and a positive attitude.

You will get out of the group what you put in. Inaction and apathy will net you nothing. Genuine interest and effort will be recognized and rewarded.


### Professionalism
Mistakes are expected, but we must own up to shortcomings and strive to do better next time. Finger-pointing and blame-shifting are unhelpful.

Individuality and expression are encouraged. However, that freedom of expression is limited to the extent that it is not disruptive to others in the group.

Everyone within the group is assumed to be an adult and is expected to act like one.



## Chapter Three: Policy

### General Conduct
1. All ESC personnel should strive to exhibit conduct that reflects Chapter Two: Code principles at all times.
2. Interpersonal conflicts between members should be resolved by a cool-headed conversation first, if at all possible. If a dispute arises that cannot be settled this way, or if there is a situation that requires immediate intervention, the situation should be escalated to officer staff.
2. Disciplinary actions are administered by officer staff or members of the Omega Bureau. Officers and Omega Bureau Arbiters are afforded the full trust of Command and the discretion to administer as they see fit. This includes up to removal or banning if necessary.
   - All decisions made by officers and the Omega Bureau are considered final (barring overrides by a Director).
     - Attempts to argue with, ignore, or otherwise circumvent these decisions will be met with additional disciplinary measures. 
3. ESC personnel will follow the established chain of command. 
   - Nobody should go straight to Command staff without a good reason. Command staff oversee day-to-day operations and are typically very busy. 
     - This does not mean Command should never be approached, but their limited free time should be respected.
   - The vast majority of issues that crop up can and should be addressed by either a direct supervisor, NCO, or officer. These resources should be used first.


### Visitors
1. We want new people to come see our sim and join us. Unarmed visitors will be treated like guests unless they cause problems.
   - If a visitor acts up, whoever is in charge on sim at the time should send the visitor a warning in IMs to stop what they are doing.
   - If the individual is griefing, an estate manager should be contacted to intervene.
   - All estate management actions are logged. Recordings and screen captures should be forwarded to officer staff.

2. Armed (weapons drawn) individuals that exit the attacker spawn are generally considered hostile.
   - A visitor who is not known to regularly attack ESC should be given an opportunity to disarm. An IM request to stand down is sufficient.
   - If the visitor is given an opportunity to disarm and fails to comply in a reasonable amount of time, they are a hostile target.

3. Visitors invited by ESC personnel are allowed in restricted areas with the stipulation that the invitee is solely responsible for their guest's behavior.
   - Individuals who abuse this trust may have their privilege to bring friends revoked or face additional discipline as needed.


### Combat Protocols
1. During combat, the designated officer in charge (OIC) is the individual responsible for all combat-related decisions.
   - OIC directives must be followed by everyone regardless of rank for the duration of that particular combat event. Despite the implication of the name, OICs are not always and do not necessarily need to be officers.
   - Any messages from opponents should be passed to the OIC to be addressed and not responded to individually. This is to ensure communication stays clear.
   - The OIC should be given a reasonable amount of time to address problems. If there are multiple issues, they should be IMed to the OIC in a list. Recordings and screenshots should be forwarded to the OIC if they are obtained. For some issues, proof is the only way to get a resolution.

2. ESC primarily makes use of Discord for external text and voice communication, including announcements.
   - Personnel are generally expected to be able to at least log in to hear what is going on. Being able to talk is NOT required; many folks make use of text-to-speech.
   - ESC personnel should have their nicknames set to match their SL username or display name, or at least have it in parentheses. 

3. During any combat operations, communcation should be limited to combat-pertinent conversation. Light banter is fine, but it should not overwhelm combat pertinent communication or be disruptive.
   - Individuals who become upset or find themselves complaining a lot are strongly recommended to take a break.
   - Participants who fail to comply with a request to pipe down will lose their voice privileges. 
   - ESC personnel are not permitted to mute other ESC personnel. If there is an inter-personnel problem, it should be resolved in other ways.

4. Gear restrictions apply.
   - ESC personnel may only use gear made available from the official armory.
     - Non-standard and unreleased versions of ESC gear are reserved for R&D/QA and are only permitted for the purpose of testing official projects.
     - Personal project items and independently commissioned works are prohibited.
     - ESC personnel are only permitted to use store-bought gear if the gear is a commercially-sold variant of something already in the ESC armory, and only on a limited basis. The armory counterpart should be unlocked and replace the store-bought version as soon as possible.
   - A [gear authorization list](https://epsilonsecurityconsulting.net/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=36) for individual ESC items is maintained by the Combat Operations department.
     - Internal only - you must be logged in to view this page.
   -  Civilians have a [separate list](https://epsilonsecurityconsulting.net/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=641) (public) of approved gear. 


#### Defensive Protocols
1. Some attackers who come to fight don't organize under a group and instead fight independently. These "lone wolves" typically come with lower-quality firepower and less tactical advantage than participants in an organized group do. To keep things fair, lone wolves should be handled on a strictly one-to-one ratio. Limited exceptions apply as noted below:
   - The attacker(s) use equipment more powerful than what the defenders have available and the only way to compensate the imbalance is to add more defenders.
   - Additional ESC personnel are invited by the lone wolf.
2. All ESC personnel are expected to be aware of our own sim rules. The most recent edition can be found [here](https://github.com/Nivanglus/Epsilon-Rules/blob/master/Rules.md).
   - Ignorance of these rules is not an excuse and will not be tolerated.
2. The defending OIC may ask groups to leave if combat becomes disruptive or tiresome.


#### Offensive Protocols
1. ESC personnel are responsible for following the defending group's rules while visiting.
   - The OIC of the raid party should be, or work to become, familiar with the defending group’s rules and alert the raiding party to key restrictions or special conditions if they apply.
   - Ideally, a copy of the opponent’s rules of engagement should be made available to the party before deployment or upon arrival.
   - The OIC is responsible for ensuring that all members of the raid party arrive and are able to set their home points in the appropriate place.
   - The raid party should attempt to deploy and exit roughly together to avoid unnecessary strain on sim resources.

2. ESC personnel are permitted to engage in combat independent from ESC. Stipulations apply.
   - ESC personnel may not wear the ESC uniform or tag or otherwise imply that they are acting on behalf of ESC while fighting independently.
   - ESC gear is acceptable to use, up to and including vehicles, but excluding unreleased and unfinished items.
     - OIC requests to test/examine gear should be referred to that group's diplomacy rep or an officer with R&D competency.
   - ESC personnel will not be protected from the administrative actions of sim owners and other groups made in response to unofficial, off-group activities. 
     - ESC will not act to appeal any admin actions imposed by other SLMC groups in response to ESC personnel acting as lone wolves.
     - ESC officers and Omega bureau personnel reserve the right to impose additional internal discipline as necessary depending on the context and severity of misconduct as observed.
     - **Bottom line: you are on your own. Exercise discretion and common sense.**

### Dress Code

##### Modifications
1. Everyone is encouraged to add personality to their uniforms and modify to their taste. As mentioned in Chapter Two: Code, there should be a balance between individual expression and group representation.
   - Modifications are generally acceptable as long as they do not:
     - Clash with the overall theme of the armor,
     - Are not highly distracting to others, and,
     - Are not overly demanding of resources (excessive poly count or script load).
2. Specific to the Kusanagi Hard Suit: "key" pieces (the chest piece, upper arms, and thigh pieces) may not be replaced, removed, shrunk down, or otherwise obscured to the point that they no longer can be easily seen in the overall appearance.
   - Official ESC-issue modifications such as the Diamas Pattern Shoulder Guard and Ashigaru Shoulder Pads are an exception to this rule. 
   - **However, if the rank badge is covered up, it should be moved to another place where it can be clearly seen, such as the chestpiece.**
3. Modifications of a revealing, explicit, or fetishistic/kinky nature are prohibited.
   - This part of the dress code was intentionally left up to interpretation, because what is considered "revealing" or "explicit" is subjective to the individual. 
   - A case-by-case approach is preferred. However, if this causes problems, stricter and more specific guidelines may be added in the future. Try to use common sense and have consideration for your fellow ESC personnel.
4. The armor should be used on bipedal, anthropomorphic avatars ONLY. Quad/feral avatars are prohibited from wearing ESC apparel.
5. If you are not sure about a modification, it is recommended that you ask for approval first instead of being asked to remove it later.
6. Modification approvals must be documented and communicated among Omega Bureau and officer staff, to prevent conflicting answers or someone going to another officer to circumvent the first officer's decision.

##### Tinting
1. Parts of the combat armor are blank textured/white and set to glow (LEDs).
  - You are encouraged to tint these LEDs in "Epsilon Blue" (hex code #8fdaff) or any color of your choosing, but ONLY those glowing areas can be any color.
  - The rest of the armor may be tinted subtly in shades of gray, but it should not be tinted dark enough to stand out from the default shade of gray. Use common sense.

##### Time and Place
1. ESC personnel are expected to wear the appropriate attire at all times while in service.
   - Either the "Kusanagi Hard Suit" or "Seraph" light set must be worn while on sim. Limited exceptions apply:
     - The space hub and lounge are designated casual areas all the time.
     - On Sundays and holidays announced ahead of time, casual wear is acceptable anywhere on the sim.
       - Personnel may defend or skirmish in casual apparel on casual days; however, raids to other regions will be uniformed as usual. 
   - The Seraph light/formal set must be worn at biweekly general meetings.
   - Casual wear still needs to follow minimum standards. No sexual, revealing outfits are allowed. Use common sense.
2. ESC personnel should be conscious of where they wear the uniform when not on duty as well.
   - Personnel are permitted to wear the uniform while off-base or not at an enemy sim, especially for conventions or other public events where ESC is participating.
     - This includes general public areas like stores, sandboxes, and other non-adult themed areas.
     - This EXCLUDES any 18+ hangouts, clubs, bars, RP sims, or anywhere where sexual activity occurs or may occur. PG ONLY.
   - In all cases, personnel should be mindful of the image they are presenting and ensure it is a positive one.

# Chapter Five: Combat Classes and Gear

ESC personnel are able to unlock a considerable array of gear to enrich and diversify the experience of combat. This is done through an in-house credits system. Credits are earned by actively participating in combat. The standard pay rate is 60 credits per hour, or one credit per minute.
To be eligible for compensation, a combat operation must meet three criteria:
  - The operation must consist of at least three individuals on at least two opposing teams.
  - The operation must have a designated OIC for each participating team.
  - The operation must be officially recorded via a report in ESC's records (at this time, on the forums).

Time spent idle during combat will not be compensated. However, if members of the ESC team initially join combat but ratio restrictions prevent their active participation, those members will still be paid as long as they continue to actively observe. Junior enlisted are generally given priority when determining who is to be placed on standby and who is to be active. Officer and command staff may, at their discretion, add bonus credits or increase the rate of pay to compensate for extraordinary events, or to increase incentive for participation.

In addition to the standard gear available to be unlocked by credits, ESC also operates with a combat class system. At a certain rank, ESC personnel are granted the ability to specialize into one of these classes for gear exclusive to that class. There is also an option to further mutliclass.

The currently available combat classes and their intended "flavor' are as follows:
- Assault
  - Aggressive and high-intensity up-in-your-face boots-on-the-ground fighting.
- Technician
  - A wide array of items made to support other classes and control the battlefield.
- Mechanized
  - Massive robots that walk on two legs with devastatingly big guns and armored tanks too.
- Airborne
  - All things that dominate the atmosphere - fighter jets, gunships, fleetships. 
 
More information about specific gear and how to progress in the class system can be found in [this document](https://github.com/ElesCloud/ESCDocuments/blob/main/CLASSES.md).
