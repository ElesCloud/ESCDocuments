## Section One: Movement Course
Bring the recruit to the movement course. The movement course can be accessed by the "Training" teleport button on the teleporter menu. This course is designed to test not just the recruit's ability to utilize SL's physics quirks, but also to test their patience and persistence.

Rules to note:
- The course must be completed fully from start to finish under a trainer's observation to pass.
- There is no time limit.
- The purple-colored pads are checkpoint areas. The recruit should set their homepoint on these to save progress. This requires the Land group.
- The course was not designed to require anything other than regular running and jumping. No movement enhancers are permitted at all.
  - This includes the standard dodgeroll in the HUD. The recruit should detach the HUD for this section.
  - Completions of the course made with the assistance of movement enhancers do not count toward passing.
- If the recruit hasn't made any progress in an extended time and there are extenuating circumstances that clearly bar them from succeeding despite their best efforts, the course *may* be skipped.
  - Examples of extenuating circumstances include: 
    - A real-life physical condition that limits their reaction time
    - Subpar internet service
    - Low-end computer hardware
  - **This must be documented clearly in the progress notes.**
  - **A recruit who misrepresents these circumstances to get out of the course will be shamed and face disciplinary action.**

Trainers are not required to lead the recruit through the entire course. However, they may be required to demonstrate specific sections to the recruit if they struggle. Therefore, trainers must be able to successfully complete the course themselves. 
* Starting with this edition of the training materials, prospective trainers will be required to demonstrate their ability before they qualify to train others.


## Section Two: One-on-One Combat
Take the recruit to the skirmish area. The trainer and any recruits should set their home points. This section is two elements: combat in its most basic form, a test of their ability to fight, and a test of reaction in the event of disadvantage.

For the first part, complete at least three short rounds one-on-one. Both trainer and recruit may only use the RF30 and frag grenades. If the recruit is able to hold their own, then they pass. If they clearly struggle, extend the combat section by as many rounds necessary until they show improvement. Point out mistakes that they make and give suggestions to improve their ability to survive.

For the second part, use any gear you have available that gives you more of a combat advantage. Do not, however, black-screen the recruit. Go for at least a short period to see how they respond to the situation. If they keep a cool head, great. If not, continue with more rounds and remind them that this is a scenario that can happen in real combat, and that it is important to keep emotions in check.

If there is more than one recruit, complete each recruit's portion of this training one at a time.

## Section Three: Official Combat
For the last section of training, the recruit must join an official, report-logged combat event to pass. They can meet this requirement by participating in any kind of combat available - raid, defense, or skirmish. They must have been present for a minimum of 30 minutes or the full combat event if it lasted less than 30 minutes.

**In keeping with the concept of input/output, it is our policy to pay recruits for all combat they participate in. A recruit who goes above and beyond the minimum should be given more than the minimum.**
- There is no failsafe way to implement this at this time because the combat HUD does not track participation time for recruits. 
- Until a system is implemented, the recruit should keep track of how long they spend fighting and report it to their trainer. This does mean we will be assuming they are reporting themselves accurately.
- The recruit will be paid retroactively for all accumulated time spent in official events at graduation. It is the trainer's responsibility to ensure that this payment is made in the final phase. Trainers who fail to compensate recruits for their time may lose training privileges.


**PHASE THREE COMPLETE. Proceed to Phase Four.**
