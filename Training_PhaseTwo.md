## Section One: Gear Acquisition
1. Bring the recruit to the armory and direct them to collect the items under the Recruit section, including:
   - The trainee uniform
   - Enlisted HUD
   - HUD gestures package.
   - The RF30 Recruit SMG
2. Have them wear the trainee uniform. This outfit is fully rigged with no parts. It is recommended that they disable all but their head and neck for this outfit.
3. Have the recruit attach the HUD and gestures package, then go to the classroom.
   
## Section Two: HUD Overview

1. Review the components of the HUD. The HUD is gesture-driven and makes use of RLV for some features. We do not force individuals to enable RLV, but without it, certain components will fail to function properly.
3. The HUD is broken down into five sections from left to right:
   - [Deployable Tools]
   - [Planted Items]
   - [Info and Movement Features]
   - [Lethal Grenades]
   - [Utility Grenades]
5. Spend some time on the center piece and the parts not displayed, such as the parkour system, grapple, and dodge roll.   
6. Take a moment to review the gesture controls provided in the pack. If you modify yours, keep a default copy for an example to explain to them.
   - Be sure to explain how our weapons operate on different "layers," one for primary weapons, two for secondaries/sidearms, and three for heavy/special weapons. One weapon can occupy each slot, and the gestures will allow a quick draw/sling to switch, rather than attaching/detaching all the time.
7. Encourage them to test out the various items (safely, without killing everyone of course) so they get a feel for how they work. Emphasize that this is considered basic knowledge for everyone. Questions and testing should be done *now*, not in the middle of live combat.
8. The reticle in the pack is optional but highly recommended. It tracks ammo count for many current issue ESC weapons, as well as energy levels for boostpacks.
9. Take the recruit back to the defender spawn area to configure their HUD Return-to-Base homepoint using the text command "/c !sethome". 
   - Explain that this alllows us to instantly go back to our defender spawn after a raid, instead of being teleported to the visitor area and having to manually run back.
   - If they did it right, the HUD will reutrn a confirmation with coordinates that looks like this:

>[13:16:31] [ESC.] Enlisted HUD -  v1.0.4: Getting Data...
>
>[13:16:31] [ESC.] Enlisted HUD -  v1.0.4: New home set to:

>REGION: Keres

>POS: <2.86206, 9.13427, 38.14831>
