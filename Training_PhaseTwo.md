In this phase, you will be covering ESC's [handbook](https://github.com/ElesCloud/ESCDocuments/blob/main/HANDBOOK.md) with the recruit. Open the handbook and explain it as best you can using your own personal example, lecture-style to the recruit. 

Watch your recruit's level of engagement. This is an interactive and variable part of the training. Read the room and go at a pace appropriate to the class you are holding.

## Section One: Code
- Ultimately, this is our "ethos," the ideals that make us who we are.
- If the recruit isn't meshing with those ideals for any reason, now is the best time to amicably part ways and minimize loss of time. 
  - In this phase of training, you aren't just educating them on our expectations, you are also monitoring for early signs of trouble. It is your job to pay attention to how receptive the recruit is to what is presented in the handbook, especially to the Code.
  - If the recruit doesn't take it seriously, you are not just allowed, but **expected**, to discuss with them and help them decide if ESC is the right group for them. There should be no hard feelings. Not everyone has to be a good fit for ESC.
- If this does happen, you should still post an update in trainer-chat. Depending on their degree of connection to the group, they may leave entirely or simply be bumped over as a Civilian. They can stick around and be friends, or sever ties completely. It's up to them.

## Section Two: Policy

Shift to Chapter Three: Policy and go over each section. While it is not necessary for anyone to completely memorize the handbook, ignorance of the rules won't be tolerated.

- Remind the recruit that the handbook will always be available for reference.
- If at any point you encounter a question you can't answer, it is your job to follow up and find that answer. "I don't know" is not acceptable.
- To ensure that the recruit has at least a basic understanding of our expectations, a quiz has been developed for use [here](https://forms.gle/wQFGguMS71cZVAGk8). 
-  This quiz requires a passing grade of 8/10. If they fail, go over Chapter Three: Policy with them again and spend more time covering the rules. It is crucial that they understand how we operate and will abide by our protocols. Remember Section One. If they are not clicking well with this part, it is not too late for them to decide to drop out.


## Section Three: Structure, Classes, Gear

Briefly cover our rank structure, from "Foundation" (trainees), to "Core" (enlisted/"contracted" and NCOs), and "Administration" (officers and command). Note combat classes (divisions) and ancillary departments as well.

Make note of the specific ranks at which contracted may choose a combat class (C-2) and begin accepting jobs (C-3).
  - As personnel are promoted, their level of responsibility will also increase. Lower C-ranks just need to show up and shoot stuff; beyond that, it gets more involved.
  - It is perfectly fine to be career enlisted, if that is all that member wants.
  - Intentionally ignoring calls to muster for combat or to appear at meetings may result in a rank reduction or even removal.
  - If you have to force yourself to show up all the time, then you should reconsider why you are part of ESC. There is no expectation to stay if you aren't having fun.

Make note of the combat classes and be sure they check the class document. (may need link rework)

Offer an opportunity to ask any questions.

**PHASE TWO COMPLETE. Proceed to Phase Three (regular training) or Phase Four (expedited).**
