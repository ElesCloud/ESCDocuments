## Chapter One: Background

> *“Epsilon Security Consulting is a subsidiary of Epsilon Pharmaceutical Corporation. Set in a dystopian future where automation has fully replaced human labor and plutocracy reigns with an iron fist, most individuals are born into a life debt owed to megacorporations that act as pseudo-governments. This life-debt is then repaid through indentured employment. This is the case specifically for Epsilon personnel. They are conscripted and sponsored by Epsilon Pharmaceutical Corporation to provide asset security in exchange for a chance at freedom.”*

Epsilon Security Consulting was created in 2019 by Nivanglus Aya, Aurora Guffey, and Sin Straaf, the original founders and Directors of the organization. The mission of Epsilon Security Consulting is to sustain and renew what remains of the Second Life Military Community however possible. Our theme draws inspiration from various sci-fi and dystopian/cyberpunk pop culture, video game, and media elements to create its own flavor unique to others in the community. We are committed to creating an enjoyable atmosphere, and we strive to ensure that everyone is welcome to join and find their place - provided that they can prove themselves.



## Chapter Two: Code

### Cooperation
The Second Life Military Community (SLMC) is made up of many different personalities, and most of them are decent. As stated above, ESC will make all reasonable attempts to ensure that the atmosphere is as welcoming and enjoyable as possible. However, a handful of individuals take advantage of the anonymity and freedom afforded to them to transgress on and disrespect others as they please. Despite the behavior on display from those individuals, there are some lines that even the SLMC won't cross. Below is a list of acts that are generally agreed upon to be the "Big Four Offenses". If you commit a "Big Four Offense", you will likely no longer be welcome anywhere in the community.

The "Big Four" are as follows:
- Distribution of identifying non-public real-life information about others without their consent or knowledge (known as doxxing)
- GPU crashing or any other griefing that is capable of or designed for permanently damaging a user's real-life PC hardware
- Creative content theft or distribution (ripping, copybotting, etc); in other words, any unauthorized use of another user's creative work
- Abuse of the AR (abuse report) system; that is, a bad-faith attempt to provoke a direct response from Linden Labs in order to get someone's account suspended or banned.
  - It is not considered abuse when individuals have a reason to involve LL for actions that go beyond the scope of what is handled within the community - for example, harassment/stalking, threats of real-life violence, or the other Big Four mentioned above.

ESC (and SL as a whole) is a population made up individuals from many walks of life. Each of us has a different set of life experiences, morals, and goals, none more or less important than any other. It is up to **everyone** in ESC at every rank and station to ensure that this diversity is leveraged as strength to the collective, instead of a source of conflict.

The Second Life Military Community has so far been a complex patchwork of many different groups throughout its nearly two decade lifespan. If you have spent any significant amount of time in the SLMC already, you will probably encounter people from your past. These people may have been on the "bad guys" side before, but we are all ESC now. **Please, leave your grudges at the door.**


### Input and Output
Epsilon Security Consulting was founded on the concept of thinking outside the box and always striving to improve. We value and seek to cultivate openness to new concepts, personal growth, adaptability, and a positive attitude.

You will get out of the group what you put in. Inaction and apathy will net you nothing. Genuine interest and effort will be recognized and rewarded.


### Professionalism
Mistakes are expected, but we must own up to shortcomings and strive to do better next time. Finger-pointing and blame-shifting are unhelpful.

Individuality and expression are encouraged. However, that freedom of expression is limited to the extent that it is not disruptive to others in the group.

Everyone within the group is assumed to be an adult and is expected to act like one.



## Chapter Three: Policy

### General Conduct
1. All ESC personnel should strive to exhibit conduct that reflects Chapter Two: Code principles at all times.
2. Interpersonal conflicts between members should be resolved by a cool-headed conversation first, if at all possible. If a dispute arises that cannot be settled this way, or if there is a situation that requires immediate intervention, the situation should be escalated to officer staff.
2. Disciplinary actions are administered by officer staff or members of the Omega Bureau. Officers and Omega Bureau Arbiters are afforded the full trust of Command and the discretion to administer as they see fit.
   - All decisions made by officers and the Omega Bureau are considered final (barring overrides by a Director).
     - Attempts to argue with, ignore, or circumvent these decisions will be met with additional, harsher disciplinary measures. 
3. ESC personnel will follow chain of command. 
   - The vast majority of issues that crop up can and should be addressed by either a direct supervisor, NCO, or officer. These resources should be consulted **first**.
   - Command staff oversee day-to-day operations and are typically busy. Nobody should go straight to Command without a good reason. 
   - This does not mean that Command can't be approached *ever*, but their limited free time should be respected and they should be seen as a last resort.


### Visitors
1. We want new people to come see our sim and join us. Unarmed visitors will be treated like guests if they behave.
   - If a visitor causes a problem, they should be contacted by IM and warned to stop before any other action is taken.
     - Exception: if the individual is clearyly griefing, an estate manager (NCO+) should be contacted to intervene immediately if not already present.
   - All estate management actions from official warnings up are to be logged. Recordings and screen captures of incidents should be forwarded to officer staff.

2. Armed (that is, weapons attached AND drawn) individuals that exit the attacker spawn are generally considered hostile.
   - Exception: a visitor who is not known to regularly attack ESC should be given an opportunity to disarm. An IM request to stand down is sufficient.
   - If a visitor is given an opportunity to disarm but moves onto the field without complying, they are considered a target.

3. Visitors invited by ESC personnel may be allowed in restricted areas with supervision.
   - The invitee of the guest is solely responsible for their guest's behavior.
   - Individuals who abuse this privilege or invite poorly-behaved guests may have the privilege revoked or face additional discipline.


### Combat Protocols
1. During combat, the designated officer in charge (OIC) is the individual responsible for all combat-related decisions.
   - OIC directives must be followed by everyone regardless of rank for the duration of an event. Despite the implication of the name, OICs do not necessarily need to be officers.
   - Any messages from opponents should be passed to the OIC to be addressed and not responded to individually.
   - The OIC should be given a reasonable amount of time to address problems. If there are multiple issues, they should be IMed to the OIC in a list. Recordings and screenshots should be forwarded to the OIC if they are obtained. For some issues, proof is the only way to get a resolution.
   - During active combat, the HUD will display a Message of the Day that lists specific gear authorizations for that event. All participants are expected to pay attention to the MOTD.
     - If you can't determine if something has been authorized, do not assume it has been. Stick to general authorization-level items until you have confirmation.

2. ESC primarily makes use of Discord for external text and voice communication, including announcements and recordkeeping.
   - Personnel are generally expected to be able to at least log in to hear what is going on. Being able to talk is NOT required. Many folks make use of the installed text-to-speech bot.
   - ESC personnel should have their nicknames set to match their SL username or display name, or at least have it in parentheses.
   - Observe COMSEC. Things discussed in internal channels should stay in internal channels.

3. During any combat operations, communcation should be limited to combat-pertinent conversation. Light banter is fine, but it should not overwhelm combat pertinent communication, be disruptive, or be overly toxic or negative.
   - Individuals who become upset or find themselves complaining a lot are strongly recommended to take a break.
   - Participants who fail to comply with a request to pipe down may be removed from combat and further disciplined.
   - ESC personnel are not permitted to mute other ESC personnel except in rare approved cases. If there is an interpersonal problem, it should be resolved in other ways.

4. Gear restrictions apply.
   - ESC personnel may only use gear made available from the official armory, no exceptions.
     - Non-standard and unreleased versions of ESC gear are reserved for R&D/QA and are only permitted for the purpose of official testing and development.
     - Personal project items and independently commissioned works are prohibited.
     - Some items in the ESC armory have commercially-sold variants. These variants are not permitted for use.
   - A gear authorization list is is maintained by the Combat Operations department alongside Command and can be found [in this spreadsheet.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vA7HMS7XBYfRmdiyk6tgSjBokKoKGt3hl99ncaxuKIo/edit#gid=0)
   -  ESC Subcontractors have their own list of approved gear to use, found [on the Subcontractors info page.](https://github.com/ElesCloud/ESCDocuments/blob/main/Subcontractors.md)


#### Defensive Protocols
1. Some attackers who come to fight don't organize under a group and instead fight independently. These "lone wolves" typically come with lower-quality firepower and less tactical advantage than participants in an organized group do. To keep things fair, lone wolves should be handled on a one-to-one ratio. Limited exceptions apply as noted below:
   - The attacker(s) use equipment more powerful than what the defenders have available and the only way to compensate the imbalance is to add more defenders.
   - Additional ESC personnel are invited by the lone wolf.
2. All ESC personnel are expected to be aware of our own sim rules. The most recent edition can be found [here](https://github.com/Nivanglus/Epsilon-Rules/blob/master/Rules.md).
   - Ignorance of these rules is not an excuse and will not be tolerated.
2. The defending OIC may ask groups to leave if combat becomes disruptive or tiresome.


#### Offensive Protocols
1. ESC personnel are responsible for following the defending group's rules while visiting.
   - The OIC of the raid party should be, or work to become, familiar with the defending group’s rules and alert the raiding party to key restrictions or special conditions if they apply.
   - Ideally, a copy of the opponent’s rules of engagement should be made available to the party before deployment or upon arrival.
   - The OIC is responsible for ensuring that all members of the raid party arrive and are able to set their home points in the appropriate place.
   - The raid party should attempt to deploy and exit roughly together to avoid unnecessary strain on sim resources.

2. ESC personnel are permitted to engage in combat on their own outside of official ESC events. Stipulations apply.
   - ESC personnel may not wear the ESC uniform or tag or otherwise imply that they are acting on behalf of ESC while fighting independently.
   - ESC gear *is* acceptable to use, up to and including vehicles, but excluding unreleased and unfinished items.
     - OIC requests to test/examine gear should be referred to that group's diplomacy rep or an officer with R&D competency.
   - ESC will not act to appeal any admin actions imposed by other SLMC groups or region owners for misconduct during unsanctioned events.
     - In addition, personnel may be subject to internal discipline as well, depending on the context and severity of misconduct that is observed.
   - **Bottom line: you are on your own. Exercise discretion and common sense.**

### Dress Code

##### Modifications
1. Everyone is encouraged to add personality to their uniforms and modify to their taste. As mentioned in Chapter Two: Code, there should be a balance between individual expression and group representation.
   - Modifications are generally acceptable as long as they do not:
     - Clash with the overall theme of the armor,
     - Are not highly distracting to others, and,
     - Are not overly demanding of resources (excessive poly count or script load).
2. Specific rules for the Kusanagi Hard Suit: 
   - At no point should the rank badge be obscured. If its default area on the upper arm piece is covered, it should be moved to somewhere else that is visible.
   - "Key" pieces of the KHS set - the chest piece, upper arms, and thigh pieces - may not be replaced, removed, shrunk down, or obscured to the point that they no longer can be easily seen overall.
     - An exception is made for the official armory-release replacements for key parts: the Ashigaru, Diamas, and Guardian shoulderpads and the Senior Contracted upper leg plates. The above rules still apply otherwise.
3. Modifications of a revealing, explicit, or fetishistic/kinky nature are prohibited.
   - This part of the dress code was intentionally left up to interpretation, because what is considered "revealing" or "explicit" is subjective to the individual. 
   - A case-by-case approach is preferred. However, if this causes problems, stricter and more specific guidelines may be added in the future. Try to use common sense and have consideration for your fellow ESC personnel.
4. The armor should be used on bipedal, anthropomorphic avatars ONLY. Quad/feral avatars are prohibited from wearing ESC apparel.
5. If you are not sure about a modification, it is recommended that you ask for approval first instead of being asked to remove it later.
6. Modification approvals and denials are documented for future referral and precedent.

##### Tinting
1. Parts of the combat armor are blank textured/white and set to glow (LEDs).
   - You are encouraged to tint these LEDs in "Epsilon Blue" (hex code #8fdaff) or any color of your choosing.
   - These parts are the ONLY parts that have NO restrictions.
2. Most of the rest of the combat armor is in shades of gray with specific trim colors.
   - Some parts of newer armor and accessories, like the Mk.2/Senior Contracted upper leg plates, has sections that are not LEDs/glowy bits, but are designed to be recolored. These non-glowing recolorable areas are treated like the non-modifiable armor trim on the default set. That means that the following colors or combinations are **reserved** for their appropriate rank brackets and unlocks
     - Red - NCO
     - Gold - Officer
     - White/gold - Command
     - Purple
     - Bounty Hunter Camo
3. The only other acceptable tint adjustment is to slightly darken the overall color of the armor set with shade of gray. This tint should be subtle. If it is too obvious and makes the wearer stand out in comparison to others, it is considered unacceptable.

|:---:|
4. This also goes for any weapons with applicable NCO/officer skins.

##### Time and Place
1. ESC personnel are expected to wear the appropriate attire at all times while in service.
   - One of the two uniforms must be worn while on sim. Limited exceptions apply:
     - The space hub and lounge are designated casual areas all the time.
     - On Sundays and holidays announced ahead of time, casual wear is acceptable anywhere on the sim.
       - Personnel may defend or skirmish in casual apparel on casual days; however, raids to other regions will be uniformed as usual. 
   - Casual wear still needs to follow minimum standards. No sexual, revealing outfits are allowed. Use common sense.
   - The Seraph light/formal set must be worn at biweekly general meetings.
3. ESC personnel should be conscious of where they wear the uniform when not on duty as well.
   - Personnel are permitted to wear the uniform elsewhere on the grid, especially for conventions or other public events where ESC is participating.
     - This includes general public areas like stores, sandboxes, and other non-adult themed areas.
     - This EXCLUDES any 18+ hangouts, clubs, bars, RP sims, or anywhere where sexual activity occurs or may occur. PG ONLY.
   - In all cases, personnel should be mindful of the image they are presenting and ensure it is a positive one.

# Chapter Five: Combat Classes and Gear

ESC personnel are able to unlock a considerable array of gear to enrich and diversify the experience of combat. This is done through an in-house credits system. Credits are earned by actively participating in combat. The standard pay rate is 60 credits per hour/one credit per minute.

To be eligible for payment, a combat operation must meet three criteria:
  - The operation must consist of at least three individuals on at least two opposing teams.
  - The operation must have a designated OIC for each participating team.
  - The operation must be officially recorded via a report in ESC's records (at this time, on the forums).

Time spent idle during combat will not be compensated. However, if members of the ESC team initially join combat but ratio restrictions prevent their active participation, those members will still be paid as long as they continue to actively observe. Junior enlisted are= given priority when determining who is actively deployed and who remains on standby. Officer and command staff may, at their discretion, add bonus credits or increase the rate of pay to compensate for extraordinary events, or to increase incentive for participation.

In addition to the standard gear available to be unlocked by credits, ESC also operates with a combat class system. At a certain rank, ESC personnel are granted the ability to specialize into one of these classes for gear exclusive to that class. There is also an option to further mutliclass.

The currently available combat classes and their intended "flavor' are as follows:
- Assault
  - Aggressive and high-intensity, up-in-your-face, boots-on-the-ground gunplay.
- Technician
  - A wide array of items made to support other classes and control the battlefield.
- Mechanized
  - Massive robots that walk on two legs with devastatingly big guns and armored tanks too.
- Airborne
  - All things that dominate the atmosphere - fighter jets, gunships, fleetships. 
 
More information about specific gear and how to progress in the class system can be found in [this document](https://github.com/ElesCloud/ESCDocuments/blob/main/CLASSES.md).



# Chapter Six: Epilogue

This handbook was designed and is currently maintained by Eles Cloud. If you have any questions, you can reach out there, or to any other officer. Suggestions are welcome.

Remember that ignorance is not an excuse for failure to observe policy.

Thank you for reading.
