## Section One: Update and Payment
- Invite the recruit to the main Epsilon Security Consulting group.
  - Not all trainers have this ability. If you don't, contact an available officer or other trainer with admin rights. **This step is critical. Please ping for a group admin or officer to send an invite if you do not have the rights to do so, before you proceed.**
- Trainees should leave the Foundation group at this point. They do not it anymore. If they don't leave it now, they will be ejected later in a periodic purge.
- Change the recruit's Discord role.
  - Epsilon Botâ€™s role command is !enlisted @discordname#tag.
  - If you can't change roles, ping for help.
- To allow full access to the armory store, the graduate's permissions and rank will need to be adjusted. 
  - An NCO+ with admin access to the armory can manually update a Conscript to Contractor on the database so they can use the Contracted Terminal to get a link to the store. This won't work unless they are in the main group and their rank has been changed.
- Contracted-level members can always access the armory store again in the future through the right-hand "Contracted Terminal" in-world.

## Section Two: Contracted Gear

After they have been successfully updated the database and their rank has been configured, the new Contracted will have access to some equipment for free.
- Weapons and tools:
  - [ESC.] Arcwelder 'Zappy Repair'
  - [ESC.] 'Astrape' Tesla Knife
  - [ESC.] G19 'Wickerman' Pistol
  - [ESC.] 'NEOLAW' Single-Use RPG
  - [ESC.] // "Huntsman" Knife
  - [ESC.] R301 Assault Rifle 
- Cosmetics
  - [ESC] \\ Diamas-Pattern Shoulder Guard
  - [ESC] \\ "Ingeniare" Helmet
  - [ESC] Enlisted helmet overlay

The new Contracted should also collect their uniforms. Pictures below to link if you want to show the recruit what a mostly unmodified set looks like out of the box without changing outfits.

Kusanagi Hard Suit - General combat use. Not for use at meetings. Made of multiple unrigged, modifiable pieces.

Seraph Light Armor - General combat use and meetings (required for meetings). Fully rigged, one piece. Not modifiable.

## Section Three: Payment

### Trainee
To start the new Contracted personnel on their fruitful career with Epsilon Security Consulting, all graduates are paid a 500-credit stipend. This is _in addition_ to any time they earned previously while participating in combat.
- This step must be done by a database admin (NCO+) just like above steps. **If you do not have admin access, ask for help.**
- All ESC gear is subject to the Authorization list found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vA7HMS7XBYfRmdiyk6tgSjBokKoKGt3hl99ncaxuKIo/). Personnel are advised to spend their credits prudently, starting with at least a few basic items that are authorized for general use, and then saving for the flashy, powerful items that are OIC authorization only.

### Trainer
Trainers will be compensated for their time and effort in training.
- The rate is 100 credits per phase completed; a fully completed standard training course from intake to exit processing is 500 credits. Expedited is 400.
- Split training between more than one instructor should be paid per phase.
- If you cannot pay yourself, ask to be paid.

## Section Four: Update
Denote the recruit's progress through phase five in the trainee-status channel on Discord.
   - Use this template in the channel to track progress:
     - Trainer:
     - Recruit:
     - Phase:
     - R/D/S: 0/0/0
     - Comments:

**PHASE FIVE COMPLETE. TRAINING COMPLETE.** 

Thank you for your continued, valuable service as a Trainer. If you have any questions, contact Eles Cloud, Chief Foundation Officer.
