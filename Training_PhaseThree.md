## Table of Contents
  - [Section One: Handbook Summary](#section-one-handbook---code)
  - [Section Two: Update](#section-five-update)

In this phase, you will briefly touch on the ESC Handbook and what it covers.

[HANDBOOK LINK](https://github.com/ElesCloud/ESCDocuments/blob/main/HANDBOOK.md)

The following key parts of the handbook should be mentioned:
 - Chapter Two: Code. This section that describes our core identity. This is who we are and why we do what we do.
 - Chapter Three: Policy. This is the meat and bones of our rules, and covers everything from how we conduct ourselves day-to-day, how we operate in combat, and how we dress in uniform.
 - Chapter Four: Structure. This section illustrates how our group is composed.
 - Chapter Five: Classes and Gear. This covers how we use gear and what's available in combat.

A brief summary is all that's needed for each section. The responsibility to read and know the handbook is now on the recruit. Remind them that they will find themselves on the business end of an ass chewing if they don't follow the handbook.
