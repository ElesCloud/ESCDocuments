## Section One: Before You Begin

- Remember that, as the trainer, **YOU** are the initial contact. YOU represent ESC and lead in with the first impression. Proper execution is critical.
  - Stay organized, timely, and polite. Get things ready *before* you send the IM to the recruit.
- Trainers are expected to follow through with all recruits they pick up, from initiating training through graduation.
- The training session time varies but can be lengthy. If you are not prepared to spend a few hours with the recruit, set up a follow-up meeting with the recruit later.
- If your plans fall through, you are responsible for checking in on your recruit.

Special note: All trainees must undergo P1/P2 to graduate to Contracted. However, some recruits will be expedited through the combat/practical phase of training if they are known to possess significant prior experience. If this condition applies, it will be indicated by the training superintendent or officer staff when the application is accepted. If no such direction is given, the recruit is to be processed as normal. 


## Section Two: Group Setup
1. Reach out to the prospective recruit. Congratulate them on their acceptance into the group and ask them if they are ready to begin.
   - As mentioned above, if you are unable to continue training after initial contact and setup, you should attempt to settle on a specific time with the recruit (avoid simply saying "sometime later") to follow up for the next session.
2. Invite the trainee to the Foundation, Home, and Land groups.
   - If you cannot furnish invitations, reach out for assistance. Ping if you need to. Officers have this ability as do many NCOs.
3. Invite them to the Discord using the link provided in the trainer channel on discord and change their role using Epsilon Bot.
   - The command is " !trainee @discordname#number "
   - All trainers should be able to do this, but if you cannot use the command, ask another trainer or the superintendent for help.
4. Denote the recruit's initiation into to Phase One in the trainer-chat on Discord.
   - This will aid us in staying efficient and organized, so we are not constantly wondering who has done what.
   - Use this template in the channel to track progress:
Trainer:
Recruit:
Phase:
R/D/S:0/0/0
Comments:
5. Have the trainee set their home in the spawn point.
6. If the new trainee is not familiar with the SLMC at all, furnish them a copy of the SLMC primer.
   - The most recent version of the primer is pinned on the Trainer discord channel chat.
   - Give the trainee plenty of time to read this and ask any questions they might have.
7. Bring the recruit to the armory and direct them to collect the items under the Recruit section, including:
   - The trainee uniform
   - "-Epsilon Standard Gear (Adony)-" (has the current HUD and a non-functional plasma knife)
   - HUD gestures - as of this edition of the guide, there are two. Fuck if I know why. As far as I can tell, they're the same.
   - The RF30 Recruit SMG
8. Bring the recruit to the classroom and go over components of the HUD. Explain to them that it is gesture-driven.
   - An infographic will be added to this guide to help you go over the HUD itself, soon (TM).
   - Gestures can be customized however the recruit would like.
   - Make sure the recruit knows that if gestures overlap on the same key, they will not work properly.
   - Allow them time to test if they want.
9. Ensure the trainee has a copy of the handbook [at this link](https://github.com/ElesCloud/ESCDocuments/blob/main/HANDBOOK.md).

**PHASE I COMPLETE. Proceed to Phase Two.**
