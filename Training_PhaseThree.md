In this phase, you will be covering ESC's culture, policies, and structure to the recruit. You will explain the handbook to them lecture-style, in an approach that works best for you (as long as it still conveys all of the necessary information). Watch your recruit's level of engagement. This is an interactive and variable part of the training. Read the room and go at a pace/use a level of verbiage appropriate to the class you are holding.

[HANDBOOK LINK](https://github.com/ElesCloud/ESCDocuments/blob/main/HANDBOOK.md)

## Section One: Handbook - Code
- This is our ethos. This section defines who we are.
- If the recruit isn't meshing with these ideals for any reason, now is the best time to amicably part ways and minimize loss of time. 
  - In this phase of training, you aren't just educating them on our expectations, you are also monitoring for early signs of trouble. It is your job to pay attention to how receptive the recruit is to what is presented in the handbook, especially to the Code.
  - If the recruit doesn't take it seriously, you are not just allowed, but **expected**, to discuss with them and help them decide if ESC is the right group for them. There should be no hard feelings. Not everyone has to be a good fit for ESC.
- If this does happen, you should still post an update in the trainee-status channel on Discord. Depending on their degree of connection to the group, they may leave entirely or simply be bumped over as a Civilian. They can stick around and be friends, or sever ties completely. It's up to them.

## Section Two: Handbook - Policy

Shift to Chapter Three: Policy and go over each section. While it is not necessary for anyone to completely memorize the handbook, ignorance of the rules won't be tolerated.

- Remind the recruit that the handbook will always be available for reference.
- If at any point you encounter a question you can't answer, it is your job to follow up and find that answer. "I don't know" is not acceptable.

## Section Three: Handbook - Structure, Classes, Gear

1. Briefly cover our rank structure, from "Foundation" (trainees), to "Core" (enlisted/"contracted" and NCOs), and "Administration" (officers and command).
2. Illustrate in more detail our "input/output" concept as it relates to rank, structure, and job choices.
  - Everyone's contribution, from simply attending regularly to beyond, is valued and appreciated. 
  - Rank-chasing is a bad idea and will only lead to sadness and frustration.
    - Promotions are assigned based not just on level of contribution, but the caliber of one's leadership qualities. 
    - A member's rank is a signifier not only of their time and effort dedicated to the group, but also trust.
    - **Everyone in this group should putting in time and effort because they enjoy doing it and want to, not because they expect a promotion.**
  - It's fine to take breaks from ESC sometimes, both short and extended as needed. However, there's a difference between taking a break and going AWOL.
    - The difference is in keeping us apprised of the situation. Tell us you need a break, don't just disappear.
    - If someone is avoiding us because of a problem, they need to make an effort to speak up about it. We can't resolve problems we are not aware of.
    - If that doesn't help and they are still not happy, they are free to leave. Our members should be here because they want to be, not because they feel like they have to be.
3. Make note of the combat classes and be sure they check the [class document](https://github.com/ElesCloud/ESCDocuments/blob/main/CLASSES.md) for details on how class ranks work and what specialized gear is available to each class.
4. Make note of the different ancillary departments and what they do. Some can be joined on request (training, combat ops), while others you must demonstrate applicable skillsets and will be selected to join (RND, QA, Omega).

## Section Four: Recap and Test
To ensure that the recruit has at least a basic understanding of our expectations, a quiz has been developed for use [here](https://forms.gle/wQFGguMS71cZVAGk8). 
- This quiz is open-book, but it was designed to be tricky, so the trainee should think before they answer or ask questions for clarification.
- The trainee should receive a score response immediately after they complete it.
- If they miss ANY of the questions, go over the handbook with them again and spend more time covering the rules. 
  - It is crucial that they understand how we operate and will abide by our protocols. Remember Sections Two and Three. If they are not clicking well with these parts, it is not too late for them to decide to drop out.
- Offer an opportunity to ask any questions as a recap.

## Section Five: Update
Denote the recruit's progress in the trainee-status channel on Discord.
   - Use this template in the channel to track progress:
