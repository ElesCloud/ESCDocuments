## Section One: Database Registration
1. Invite the recruit to the main Epsilon Security Consulting group.
   - Not all trainers have this ability. If you don't, contact an available officer or other trainer with admin rights. This must be done before any other part of this phase can be successfully completed! **IM or ping if you have to, this is important!**
2. Make them leave the Foundation group, and if they had it, the Land group. They do not need either of these groups anymore. If they don't leave them now, they will probably be ejected later.
3. Change the recruit's Discord role.
   - Epsilon Botâ€™s role command is !enlisted @discordname#tag.
   - If you can't change roles, seek assistance.
4. Bring the recruit to the Armory and have them click the **terminal on the pedestal** to connect their Second Life account to the web-based database and to the forums.![terminal yes-no](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71983240/148656441-adaa8a04-beb3-4b41-b6d1-9203a1fdbfb6.png)


Important information about the database and the forums:
- On the initial registration click, the terminal will not only set their account up, but will also provide them a temporary password in their local chat **for the forums**. Have them [log in](https://epsilonsecurityconsulting.net/index.php) and change their password.
- Explain that the web database tracks individual rank and class, and most of the gear we keep is documented and distributed through this website.
- You will need to go into the database and manually edit their new user file from Rank: Conscript to Rank: Contracted. If you cannot do this, ask for help right away.
- Anytime they click the terminal on the pedestal after initial registration, it provides a direct link to the database. The terminal on the wall will allow them to reset their password on the database.
- The forums have to be manually assigned by an admin (Nikki, usually). You can contact her if she is available, otherwise the recruit may have to wait a little bit.


## Section Two: Contracted Gear

After they have been successfully registered to the database and their rank has been configured, the new Contracted will have access to some equipment for free.
- Weapons and tools:
  - [ESC.] Arcwelder 'Zappy Repair'
  - [ESC.] 'Astrape' Tesla Knife
  - [ESC.] G19 'Wickerman' Pistol
  - [ESC.] 'NEOLAW' Single-Use RPG
  - [ESC.] // "Huntsman" Knife
  - [ESC.] R301 Assault Rifle 
- Cosmetics
  - [ESC] \\ Diamas-Pattern Shoulder Guard
  - [ESC] \\ "Ingeniare" Helmet
  - [ESC] Enlisted helmet overlay

The new Contracted should also collect their uniforms. Pictures below to link if you want to show the recruit what a mostly unmodified set looks like out of the box without changing outfits.

Kusanagi Hard Suit - General combat use. Not for use at meetings. Made of multiple unrigged, modifiable pieces.

## Section Three: Payment

### Trainee
To start the new Contracted personnel on their fruitful career with Epsilon Security Consulting, all graduates are paid a 500-credit stipend, in addition to any time they earned previously while participating in combat. As mentioned in Phase Four, this does involve taking the trainee's word for it. We accept the risk this involves.
- This step must be done by someone who has the ability to import time on the database (NCO+). **If you can't or don't know how, ask for help.**
- All ESC gear is subject to the Authorization list found [here](https://epsilonsecurityconsulting.net/viewforum.php?f=10) (secure, must be logged in). Personnel are advised to spend their credits prudently, starting with basic items that are authorized for general use, and then working towards the flashy, powerful items that only get authorized for use on occasion.

### Trainer
Trainers will be compensated for their time and effort.
- The rate is 100 credits per phase completed; a fully completed standard training course from intake to exit processing is 500 credits. Expedited is 400.
- Split training between more than one instructor should be paid per phase.
- If you cannot pay yourself, ask to be paid.

## Section Four: Update
