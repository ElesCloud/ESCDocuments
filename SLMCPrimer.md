## SECTION ONE: Description and Purpose

This document is a general-level guide on the basics of the Second Life Military Community. It is made from the perspective of Epsilon Security Consulting and it is intended for individuals who are interested in learning about how the community operates, whether they are part of ESC or not.


## SECTION TWO: What exactly is the SLMC?

The Second Life Military Community is a cluster of self-identified combat groups on Second Life that mutually agree to participate in Linden Labs damage combat with each other. The SLMC uses scripted weapons typically (but not always) designed to deal one-hit kills which return the target to their homepoint. The SLMC also designs and employs a variety of vehicles, gear, and technology to try and make combat more variable and interesting.

The SLMC has a complex history spanning back to the early 2000s. Many of the individuals who participate in it have been members for nearly as long as the community's genesis. Even as groups and individuals arrive, leave, and evolve over time, many of the individuals who are a part of the community are unabashedly toxic and difficult to interact with. In other words, despite the fact that we've been around for nearly 20 years, some people simply will never grow up or move on. This has mellowed to a degree since earlier days, but the necessity of this warning still remains: if you are interested in participating, be aware that you will need a thick skin to survive.


## SECTION THREE: General Etiquette Do's and Don'ts

There are certain behaviors expected of everyone participating in the Second Life Military Community, whether they are affiliated with a group or a lone wolf. While we will usually attempt to politely correct your mistake at first, failure to comply could result in anything from being made fun of to being shot, ejected, or banned. The following is a list of some basic DOs and DON'Ts that apply to the majority of participating groups:

- DO: Set your home. When you enter a combat sim, please join the spawn group and set your home point in the spawn area. 
  - Second Life is poorly optimized and dated software. Because of that, leaving and especially entering a sim can cause what is known as a "rez queue," where bullets, grenades, and other assets cannot be rezzed until the sim is done loading you. This can last from a moment to a few minutes, depending on the avatar and server, and brings combat to a halt. 
  - If you leave and re-enter a sim every time you die, you will likely incur the ire of the group you are visiting.
- DO: Wear clothes. SLMC sims are not sex sims. We don’t want to see genitals, even if you make them invisible. There are plenty of other places on SL that exist just for that.
- DO: Be aware of escalation. The SLMC is very well armed, but we prefer to use gear similar to what you are using to make for a fair fight. 
  - If you come to fight with a basic assault rifle, most groups will use their basic weapons also. By the same principle, if you bring out a tank, rocket launcher, or heavy machine gun, you can expect similar force used against you. 
- DO: Read the rules. When you enter a combat sim for the first time, take five minutes to grab the rules and read. Even if you are not doing combat, there may be areas that are off limits to visitors or certain attachments that are not permitted. Just read. It isn't hard. You're doing it right now.
- DO: Keep your cool. This is a game. We do this for our enjoyment, period. If you are having a bad time, there is nothing stopping you from leaving. If you are becoming frustrated enough for loud complaining or foul play, you should probably take a break instead. Remember, thick skin to survive.

- DO NOT: Try to explore while armed. If you are just visiting a group that you are not enlisted in, take off your guns or at least sling them. When you enter, you are being watched. If you appear to be combative, you can expect to be killed.
- DO NOT: Use avatar flight. Avatar flight is disabled in SLMC combat sims. Do not override this unless it is your own sim. If you choose to ignore this, expect to be targeted with prejudice.
- DO NOT: Cheat. Using client-side features such as wireframe mode, avatar hitboxes, spacebar hovering, disabling pre-jump animations (see glossary for more info), and anything else that gives an unfair advantage, is considered unsportsmanlike and is banned in most SLMC sims. We can tell if you are cheating. Don't do it. If you are not removed from the sim for it, you will be met with extreme force or worse.
- DO NOT: God-mode. The SLMC does military-style combat with weapons. This is not the place for magic HUDs. Additionally, equipment like auto killers, orbiters, and anything else you might find in a griefing HUD will likely get you kicked out, temp-banned, or put on an auto killer.
- DO NOT: Grief or crash sims. People pay good money to have a sim to do their thing on. If you interrupt people doing their thing, they probably won't like you very much and you might not be welcome there anymore. Or they might grief you back way harder than you bargained on. Either way, it won't go well for you. If you outright crash the sim, this is not only a denial of the service being paid for, which is a shitty thing to do by itself, but it can also roll back hours of work on scripts, avatars, the sim build and more. You usually will not be welcome back if you do this and other sim owners will be informed of what you've done as well.


## SECTION FOUR: The Big Four

THE “BIG FOUR”: As mentioned previously, the SLMC is a place where you need a thick skin to survive. We handle our own disputes internally, usually without perma-bans, and almost always without getting Linden Labs involved. However, there are four types of actions that will ensure you will be unilaterally removed from this community and not be able to return:
- Doxxing: Releasing someone's real life information that they have not made publicly accessible via Second Life. It is morally reprehensible even by the standards of the SLMC. If there is proof you've done this, not only will you be banned and reviled by the entire community, this is one instance where we permit the filing of an abuse report or law enforcement above and beyond.
- Graphics Crashing: Computer hardware is expensive. Graphics crashing can damage a person’s computer and prevent them from being able to participate in this community. This is not tolerated by any group. You will be banned and other sim owners will be informed who will also likely ban you to protect themselves.
- Asset theft: Our content creators work hard to produce the many wonderful things we enjoy. Copybotting or open sourcing assets that do not belong to you is theft, period. This is not tolerated and you will be removed from the community. 
- Abusing the AR system: As mentioned above, the SLMC handles most of its problems internally. Invoking the abuse report system for a problem that can otherwise be addressed within the community, abusing it to file false reports, and convincing others to mass-report in order to increase the chances of getting Linden Labs’ attention is grounds for community expulsion.


## SECTION FIVE: Glossary

The SLMC is deeply intertwined with the more technical side of Second Life as well as FPS gaming in general. There are some concepts and terms we may take for granted that can look like jargon to the unfamiliar. The following list has been compiled of some of those terms and their meanings:

- **Dodgeroll**: Most groups in the SLMC utilize a type of scripted movement enhancement called a dodgeroll. This a quick dash or roll of no more than 10 meters with a cool-down period in between uses. It is considered a standard feature by most groups.
- **Hard fall**: This is a moment of immobility when you've landed on your face after falling a long distance. Disabling this is considered cheating and typically prohibited in most SLMC sims.
- **Hitbox**: The physical, normally invisible collision box centered on your avatar position that determines whether or not you take fire and are killed. It is literally box-shaped and unaffected by crouching or limb movement. This hitbox stays under your name tag, even if an animation moves your visible avatar somewhere else. If your AO moves your visible avatar totally out of your hitbox, you may be asked to disable it, as this can be seen as dishonest play. Your hitbox naturally moves slightly ahead of your avatar when you are in motion.
- **LBA**: Listen-Based-Armor is a scripting system that allows objects such as vehicles and barricades to absorb enemy fire and track damage points. It is the modern replacement for old HP/AT systems that relied solely on prim collisions to do damage. Using a standardized script, Listen-Based-Armor greatly reduces the strain on SL’s physics engine and allows for much more dynamic systems of armor. There are variants such as LBA lite which takes damage from collision in addition to LBA weapons, and LBA-D which takes reduced damage depending on directionality to simulate variations in armor density. You may learn more about this complex topic from the many fine scripters of the SLMC or from the following link: https://github.com/Krutchen/SLMCLBA
- **Pre-firing**: This is a common FPS tactic. Pre-firing is when you guess/estimate when someone is about to round a corner and fire where you think they're about to appear. The minimap is the easiest tool to use for this.
- **Pre-jump**: The delay between pressing jump and actually jumping. This simulates needing to crouch before springing into the air. Disabling this delay is considered cheating by the SLMC.
- **Prim jump**: This is when you combine a jump with the upward motion of stepping up onto a prim for a huge boost in jump height. This takes practice to learn the timing. Unlike some of the other actions listed here, prim jumping is acceptable play in the SLMC.
- **Prim shooting**: This is when you shoot someone through a wall. Due to Second Life's notoriously unoptimized physics engine, bullets do not always stop on impact with a wall and will keep going for a moment. Accidents happen, but doing this intentionally is considered cheating.
- **Raycast/RC**: This is a scripting feature in Second Life. Very simplified, in the context of a weapon, it means that rather than launching a projectile with the physics engine, the weapon uses a beam or "ray" to detect what the weapon is pointed at and moves an object to that location. This happens almost instantly whereas the speed limit of a projectile in Second Life is approximately 200 m/s. As such, it is sometimes considered a more powerful kind of weapon. Some weapons such as snipers or shotguns may use multiple rays at once to form a detection cone rather than a pinpoint. This is a complex topic and you can learn more from a scripter or from http://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/LlCastRay
- **Render Weight**: This is how hard someone's computer has to work to render your avatar. The harder one's computer must work, the fewer frames per second they get. In combat, frames per second are very important, and as such, the SLMC generally frowns upon render weights greater than about 100,000. Generally, the more complex your avatar, the higher its render weight, but not strictly. This is an extremely technical matter and you can find more information at http://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/Mesh/Rendering_weight 
- **Safe zone/spawn area**: In SLMC sims, your spawn point is usually contained within a safe zone where the opposing team is not permitted to enter during combat. Each group will define their own safe zone and protocol regarding it for both the defenders and the attackers. Intentionally entering the opposing safe zone is considered poor manners and will typically be responded to with force.
- **Space-barring**: The space bar allows you to hover in mid air or cancel a hard-fall. This is considered by most to be a crutch for poorly skilled combatants and some sims outright ban this.
