# Chapter One: Introduction
The intended purpose of this document is to explain how the class and unlock system works to all members of ESC.
 
Because this is a **live** document that may change frequently, updates are detailed in the commit log.

# Chapter Two: How to Rank Up
Upon obtaining a promotion to rank C-2, each ESC member will be given the chance to choose a primary class. Rank points are generated through raids and defenses. Skirmishes are not eligible to count towards progress. As always, credits are awarded one per minute/60 per hour and are used to purchase items that are both locked with class points and available to the general pool.

Below is a list of the each rank and the minimum requirements to reach each one:
- R1: Promoted to rank C-2
- R2: Participated in 20 combat operations
- R3: Participated in 30 combat operations
- R4: Participated in 40 combat operations
- R5: Participated in 50 combat operations

While each class has its own flavor, and of course, choosing your first is a big step, there is more beyond that. The ability to multiclass is available upon reaching Rank 5 in your primary class. At Rank 5, you will be able to obtain an additional five rank points through continued combat contribution and place them in the remaining classes as desired. They are not constrained to any specific class beyond your first five. Want to have two points in a secondd class and three more in a third? It's your choice.

Below are the requirements for the remaining five points:
- R6: 60 Combat operations
- R7: 70 Combat operations
- R8: 80 Combat operations
- R9: 90 Combat operations
- R10: 100 Combat operations


# Chapter Three: Senior Contracted and Class Resets

## Senior Contracted
When an ESC Contracted member reaches C-8, they may be eligible for an opportunity to branch out into senior contracted ranks. The Senior Contracted system has been put in place to offer additional advancement to those who will not be permitted to or have decided not to take on the responsibilities required to advance into NCO+. Through this system, additional rewards are made available such as: class points, weapons, cosmetics, and so on. Senior Enlisted ranks are earned through peer recommendation, and those recommendations are reviewed by NCO+ and awarded during regular promotion cycles along with other promotions. Below are the current unlocks available at each level.

## Class Resets
Do you feel that the primary class you chose was not the right pick? Every ESC member is afforded ***one*** opportunity to respec. If you choose to respec, your one free "respec token" will be expended and your primary class points will be made available again be reapplied to a different class. By doing this, you will lose access to any unlocks from the classes you left behind. 

Contact a member of Command to do this until the database function is added.
