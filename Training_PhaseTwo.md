## Section One: Recruit Gear and Registration
+ Bring the recruit to the armory and direct them to collect the items under the Recruit section, including:
   - The trainee uniform
   - Enlisted HUD
   - HUD gestures package.
   - The RF30 Recruit SMG
+ Have them wear the trainee uniform. This outfit is fully rigged with no parts. It is recommended that they disable all but their head and neck for this outfit.
+ The recruit must click on the left-side terminal that is labeled "Trainee Terminal." This will sync their SL account to both the forums and armory database.
  - Explain that the database is where much of our gear distribution happens and registration is mandatory. More on how to earn points to buy stuff in a later phase.
+ They will receive a message in local chat with their assigned forum password. Right away, the recruit should:
  - Log in to the forums [here](https://epsilonsecurityconsulting.net/index.php) with their **legacy SL username (FirstName LastName)** and this assigned password;
  - Change the password to something else;
  - Bookmark the link to the forums for later.
+ Limited access to DB and forums is granted at this point and will be expanded to full access at graduation.

## Section Two: HUD Overview

+ Return to the classroom. Have the recruit attach the HUD and gestures. Explain the components of the HUD. 
   - The HUD uses SL gestures as hotkeys and makes use of RLV for some features.
     - Users are recommended to disable other gestures they may have active. Gestures that use the same shortcut keys will not work.
     - Individuals are not strictly required to enable RLV, but without it, certain components of the HUD will fail to function properly.
+ Explain the five sections of the HUD as laid out in this diagram:

|:---:|

+ Feel free to share the link with them [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ElesCloud/ESCDocuments/main/HUDdiagram-main.png). Copies may be obtained for use as images in-world from Foundation administration upon request.
+ Take a moment to review the gesture controls provided in the pack. If you modify yours, keep a default copy for an example to explain to them.
+ Explain the weapon layer system: 1 for primary weapons, 2 for secondaries/sidearms, and 3 for heavy/special weapons. One weapon can occupy each slot; the gestures will allow a quick draw/sling to switch, rather than attaching/detaching all the time.
+ Trainees should take time to playtest the HUD functions (carefully, without killing everyone) so they get a feel for how they work. 
  - **This is considered basic knowledge for everyone. Questions should be fielded and answered _now_, not in the middle of live combat.**
+ The reticle in the pack is optional but highly recommended. It tracks ammo count for many current issue ESC weapons, as well as energy levels for boostpacks.
+ Take the recruit back to the defender spawn area to configure their HUD Return-to-Base homepoint using the text command "/c !sethome". 
  - Explain that this alllows us to instantly go back to our defender spawn after a raid, instead of being teleported to the visitor area and having to manually run back.
   - If they did it right, the HUD will reutrn a confirmation with coordinates that looks like this:

>[13:16:31] [ESC.] Enlisted HUD -  v1.0.4: Getting Data...
>
>[13:16:31] [ESC.] Enlisted HUD -  v1.0.4: New home set to:
> 
>REGION: Keres
>
>POS: <2.86206, 9.13427, 38.14831>

## Section Three: Update
