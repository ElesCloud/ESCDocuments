## Section One: Before You Begin

- Remember that, as the trainer, **YOU** are the initial contact. YOU represent ESC and lead in with the first impression. Proper execution is critical.
  - Stay organized, timely, and polite. Get things ready *before* you send the IM to the recruit.
- Trainers are expected to follow through with all recruits they pick up, from initiating training through graduation.
- The training session time varies but can be lengthy. If you are not prepared to spend a few hours with the recruit, set up a follow-up meeting with the recruit later.
- If your plans fall through, you are responsible for checking in on your recruit.

Special note: All trainees must undergo P1/P2 to graduate to Contracted. However, some recruits will be expedited through the combat/practical phase of training if they are known to possess significant prior experience. If this condition applies, it will be indicated by the training superintendent or officer staff when the application is accepted. If no such direction is given, the recruit is to be processed as normal. 


## Section Two: Group Setup
1. Reach out to the prospective recruit. Congratulate them on their acceptance into the group and ask them if they are ready to begin.
   - As mentioned above, if you are unable to continue training after initial contact and setup, you should attempt to settle on a specific time with the recruit (avoid simply saying "sometime later") to follow up for the next session.
2. Invite the trainee to the Foundation, Home, and Land groups.
   - If you cannot furnish invitations, reach out for assistance. Ping if you need to. Officers have this ability as do many NCOs.
3. Invite them to the Discord using the link provided in the trainer channel on discord and change their role using Epsilon Bot.
   - The command is " !trainee @discordname#number "
   - All trainers should be able to do this, but if you cannot use the command, ask another trainer or the superintendent for help.
4. Denote the recruit's initiation into to Phase One in the trainer-chat on Discord.
   - This will aid us in staying efficient and organized, so we are not constantly wondering who has done what.
   - Use this template in the channel to track progress:
     - Trainer:
     - Recruit:
     - Phase:
     - R/D/S: 0/0/0
     - Comments:
5. Have the trainee set their client homepoint in the spawn area and configure their HUD Return-to-Base homepoint also using /c !sethome.

## Section Three: Gear and Documentation
1. Bring the recruit to the armory and direct them to collect the items under the Recruit section, including:
   - The trainee uniform
   - "-Epsilon Standard Gear (Adony)-" (has the current HUD and an old outdated plasma knife)
   - HUD gestures package.
   - The RF30 Recruit SMG
2. Bring the recruit to the classroom and go over components of the HUD. Explain to them that it is gesture-driven.
   - Link the trainee to the [HUD Diagram](https://github.com/ElesCloud/ESCDocuments/blob/main/huddiagram%20labeled.png).
   - Note that the gestures on the diagram and in the folder are the defaults, but they can be customized however the recruit would like.
   - Make sure they look at the gestures. Most of them are self-explanatory, but if the recruit wants to know what one does, explain it to them.
   - Make a note that if gestures overlap on the same key, they will not work properly.
   - Allow them time to test if they want.
3. If the new trainee is not familiar with the SLMC at all, furnish them a copy of the [SLMC primer](https://github.com/ElesCloud/ESCDocuments/blob/main/SLMCPrimer.md)..
   - Give the trainee plenty of time to read this and ask any questions they might have.
4. Ensure the trainee has a copy of the handbook [at this link](https://github.com/ElesCloud/ESCDocuments/blob/main/HANDBOOK.md).

**PHASE ONE COMPLETE. Proceed to Phase Two.**
