In this phase, you will be covering ESC's [handbook](https://github.com/ElesCloud/ESCDocuments/blob/main/HANDBOOK.md) with the recruit. Open the handbook and explain it as best you can using your own personal example, lecture-style to the recruit. 

Watch your recruit's level of engagement. This is an interactive and variable part of the training. Read the room and go at a pace appropriate to the class you are holding.

## Section One: Code
- Ultimately, this is our "ethos," the ideals that make us who we are.
- If the recruit isn't meshing with those ideals for any reason, now is the best time to amicably part ways and minimize loss of time. 
  - In this phase of training, you aren't just educating them on our expectations, you are also monitoring for early signs of trouble. It is your job to pay attention to how receptive the recruit is to what is presented in the handbook, especially to the Code.
  - If the recruit doesn't take it seriously, you are not just allowed, but **expected**, to discuss with them and help them decide if ESC is the right group for them. There should be no hard feelings. Not everyone has to be a good fit for ESC.
- If this does happen, you should still post an update in trainer-chat. Depending on their degree of connection to the group, they may leave entirely or simply be bumped over as a Civilian. They can stick around and be friends, or sever ties completely. It's up to them.

## Section Two: Policy

Shift to Chapter Three: Policy and go over each section. While it is not necessary for anyone to completely memorize the handbook, ignorance of the rules won't be tolerated.

- Remind the recruit that the handbook will always be available for reference.
- If at any point you encounter a question you can't answer, it is your job to follow up and find that answer. "I don't know" is not acceptable.

## Section Three: Structure, Classes, Gear

Briefly cover our rank structure, from "Foundation" (trainees), to "Core" (enlisted/"contracted" and NCOs), and "Administration" (officers and command).

Illustrate in more detail our "input/output" concept as it applies to rank.
  - As personnel are promoted, their level of responsibility they receive is increased. Lower C-ranks just need to show up, but beyond that, it gets more involved.
    - If a person joins and they have no interest in doing anything other than combat, there is no shame in staying career Contracted.
    - Higher-ranked individuals have proven themselves to be trustworthy and have dedicated more time and effort to the group, but that does not mean they are more important.
    - Everyone's contribution is appreciated.
  - It's fine to take breaks from ESC sometimes, both short and extended as needed. However, there's a difference between taking a break and going AWOL.
    - If they are avoiding us because of a problem, they need to say something. We can't resolve problems we are not aware of.
    - If that doesn't help and they are still not happy, they are free to depart. Our members should be here because they want to be, not because they feel like they have to be.

Make note of the combat classes and be sure they check the [class document](https://github.com/ElesCloud/ESCDocuments/blob/main/CLASSES.md) for details on how class ranks work and what specialized gear is available to each class.

Make note of the different ancillary departments and what they do.

To ensure that the recruit has at least a basic understanding of our expectations, a quiz has been developed for use [here](https://forms.gle/wQFGguMS71cZVAGk8). 
-  This quiz requires a passing grade of 8/10. The quiz will give them a score response immediately after they complete it.
-  If they fail, go over the handbook with them again and spend more time covering the rules. It is crucial that they understand how we operate and will abide by our protocols. Remember Section One. If they are not clicking well with this part, it is not too late for them to decide to drop out.
- Offer an opportunity to ask any questions.

**PHASE TWO COMPLETE. Proceed to Phase [Three](https://github.com/ElesCloud/ESCDocuments/blob/main/Training_PhaseThree.md) (standard training) or Phase [Four](https://github.com/ElesCloud/ESCDocuments/blob/main/Training_PhaseFour.md) (expedited).**
