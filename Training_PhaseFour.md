## Section One: Database Registration
1. Invite the recruit to the main Epsilon Security Consulting group.
   - Not all trainers have this ability. IF you don't, contact an available officer or other trainer with admin rights. This must be done before any other part of this phase can be successfully completed.
2. Change the recruit's DIscord role.
- Epsilon Botâ€™s role command is !enlisted @discordname#tag.
- If you can't change roles, seek assistance.
3. Bring the recruit to the Armory and have them click the **terminal on the pedestal** to connect their Second Life account to the web-based database and to the forums. ![terminal yes-no](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71983240/148655928-6b606629-befd-47d1-a013-f6f1820a5ada.png)

Important information about the database and the forums:
- On the initial registration click, the terminal will not only set their account up, but will also provide them a temporary password in their local chat **for the forums**. Have them [log in](https://epsilonsecurityconsulting.net/index.php) and change their password.
- Explain that the web database tracks individual rank and class, and most of the gear we keep is documented and distributed through this website.
- You will need to go into the database and manually edit their new user file from Rank: Conscript to Rank: Contracted. If you cannot do this, ask for help right away.
- Anytime they click the terminal on the pedestal after initial registration, it provides a direct link to the database. The terminal on the wall will allow them to reset their password on the database.
