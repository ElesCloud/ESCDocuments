## Section One: Gear Acquisition
1. Bring the recruit to the armory and direct them to collect the items under the Recruit section, including:
   - The trainee uniform
   - "-Epsilon Standard Gear (Adony)-" (has the current HUD and an old outdated plasma knife)
   - HUD gestures package.
   - The RF30 Recruit SMG
2. Have them wear the trainee uniform. It is recommended that they disable all but their head and neck for this outfit.
3. Have the recruit attach the HUD and gestures package. Take the recruit back to our defender spawn area to configure their HUD Return-to-Base homepoint using /c !sethome. 
   - The recruit will need to have RLV enabled for this (and for a couple other parts of the HUD). If they don't allow it, they are unable to use this feature. They don't absolutely have to, of course, but it's recommended.
   - Explain that this alllows us to instantly go back to our defender spawn after a raid, instead of being teleported to the visitor area and having to manually run back. It's great for anytime the client homepoint is set elsewhere.
   
## Section Two: HUD Overview
1. Bring the recruit to the classroom and review the components of the HUD. The HUD is gesture-driven.
2. The HUD is broken down into five parts: [Deployable Tools], [Planted Items], [Info and Movement], [Lethal Grenades], and [Utility Grenades].
   - Each section has its own default control keys (except for info/movement) - T for tools, X for planted items, G for lethal grenades, and B for utility grenades.
   - The sections can also be expanded by clicking to choose the desired item.
3. Spend some time on the center piece and the parts not displayed, such as the parkour system, grapple, and dodge roll.   
3. Take a moment to review the gesture controls provided in the pack. If you modify yours, keep a default copy for an example to explain to them.
   - Be sure to explain how our weapons operate on different "layers," one for primary weapons, two for secondaries/sidearms, and three for heavy/special weapons. One weapon can occupy each slot, and the gestures will allow a quick draw/sling to switch, rather than attaching/detaching all the time.
4. Encourage them to test out the various items (at a distance from others) so they get a feel for how they work. Make sure they know that this is considered basic knowledge for everyone, so they should be asking questions and familiarizing *now*, not during the heat of combat.

## Section Three: Update
Denote the recruit's progress in the trainee-status channel on Discord.
