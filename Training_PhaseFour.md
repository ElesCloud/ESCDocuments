## Section One: Update and Payment
- Invite the recruit to the main Epsilon Security Consulting group.
  - Not all trainers have this ability. If you don't, contact an available officer or other trainer with admin rights. **This step is critical. Please ping for a group admin or officer to send an invite if you do not have the rights to do so, before you proceed.**
- Trainees should leave the Foundation group at this point. They do not need it anymore. If they don't leave it now, they will be ejected later in a periodic purge.
- Change the recruit's Discord role.
  - Epsilon Botâ€™s role command is !enlisted @discordname#tag.
  - If you can't change roles, ping for help.
- To allow full access to the armory store, the graduate's rank will need to be adjusted manually. 
  - An NCO+ with admin capabilities can change a Conscript to Contractor on the database so they can use the Contracted Terminal to get a link to the store. This won't work unless they are in the main group and their rank has been changed.
- Contracted-level members can always access the armory store again in the future through the right-hand "Contracted Terminal" in-world.

## Section Two: Contracted Gear

After they have been successfully updated the database and their rank has been configured, the new Contracted will have access to a variety of free weapons.
- Weapons and tools:
  - Arcwelder 'Zappy Repair' Tool
  - 'Astrape' Tesla Knife
  - "Huntsman" Knife
  - Pyrowire Katana
  - M6G 'Magnum' Pistol
  - PP-10 'Darpacell' SMG
  - 'NEOLAW' Single-Use RPG
  - R301 Assault Rifle
  - Lee-Enfield SMLE MK.III Marksman Rifle
  - MX-1 Garand Marksman Rifle
  - M-420 Grenade Pistol
  - 'Vengeance' LMG

- Vehiclees and More (**These require certification before being used**. Covered in Phase Five.)
  - M350 'Ballista' Hover Tank
  - Falken Jet Fighter
  - 80mm FedEx Mortar

- Cosmetics
  - [ESC] \\ Diamas-Pattern Shoulder Guard
  - [ESC] \\ "Ingeniare" Helmet
  - [ESC] Enlisted helmet overlay



The new Contracted should also collect the Seraph and Kusanagi Hard Suit sets. Pictures below to link if you want to show the recruit what a mostly unmodified set looks like out of the box without changing outfits.

Kusanagi Hard Suit - General combat use. **Not for use at meetings.** Made of multiple unrigged, modifiable pieces.

Seraph Light Armor - General combat use and meetings (**required for meetings**). Fully rigged, one piece. Not modifiable.

## Section Three: Payment

### Trainee
To start the new Contracted personnel on their fruitful career with Epsilon Security Consulting, all graduates are paid a 500-credit stipend. This is _in addition_ to any time they earned previously while participating in combat.
- This step must be done by a database admin (NCO+) just like above steps. **If you do not have admin access, ask for help.**
- All ESC gear is subject to the Authorization list found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vA7HMS7XBYfRmdiyk6tgSjBokKoKGt3hl99ncaxuKIo/). Personnel are advised to spend their credits prudently, starting with at least a few basic items that are authorized for general use, and then saving for the flashy, powerful items that are OIC authorization only.

## Section Four: Update
Denote the recruit's progress through phase four in the trainee-status channel on Discord.
