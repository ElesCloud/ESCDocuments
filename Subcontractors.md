## Section One: What is a Subonctractor?
Subcontractors are individuals who are permitted Epsilon Security Consulting to participate in combat with them. They are not full, official members of ESC but they are trusted friends of the group. The Subcontractor role may be offered to individuals who ask to join but have a history of negative behavior that they may need to show that they have improved beyond, or offered to individuals who do not have the time or motivation to commit to full membership, in a sort of halfway point.

## Section Two: Subcontractor Privileges
Subcontractors have limited privileges and abilities in ESC. They are allowed to be invited to combat operations communications and use a very limited selection of ESC-issued gear. These privileges are subject to revocation at any time as deemed necessary.
